it really is a shame there is still no usable autotune on ios.  
I really like **audiotune**, but it is only good for trap style vocals because there really is no subtle setting.   
**AutoTune** would be perfect if it wasnt so damn unstable. I only use it to immediately render the result, but even then i often have to try a couple of times to get it to work right. **Mu-Retune** is the worst sounding plugin ever. How anyone can use it for anything i can not understand. The one Knob **Garageband** one just has to little parameters. 4pockets **Soloist** has all the features but also produces a lot of wierd artifacts, even in hq mode, that sound like bassy transients that basically makes this one unusable for anything but backround vocals (even then it sounds messy). Also i never got the midifeatures to work. And sometimes i had instability issues with this one...
 
wave tunes would be nice with either custom scales or target pitch. the way it is now its really nothing new to ios. there are some apps that can do autotune that i didnt mention because they have no custom scales... i dont find those to be usable at all

would also love one day to see more creative approaches to autotune... like vibrato onset or even a modmatrix or triggered arps, this kind of stuff. Theres is so much popmusic with autotune out there right now, making use of many different styles and tones, i really cant believe how basic ios autotune apps still are.

When I use the regular Waves Tune I add it to the audio track, set midi input to on. Go to my midi track and set the output to waves tune plugin. On Waves tune there is a button to Receive Midi, which I turn to on. And it works. Latches on to my midi notes and makes the vocals only sync to those notes.
 
However when I start playing my audio back, the Target Pitch button turns itself off, and the plugin starts using notes that are NOT within the midi track. I'm assuming it just reverts back to the algorithmic tuning.
 
I'm also thinking it's Cakewalk because before this I was using the free plugin MAutoPitch, synced to MIDI, which worked, until I closed the session and re-opened later on. It would no longer read the midi notes and reverted back to the algorithmic correction until i deleted the plugin and re-added, re-set everything up. Does it every time I close the session. I contacted MeldaProduction and they didn't have an answer.
 
After updating to Logic 10.5 all my external plugins are not working properly: I can't see the control panels. I can only reach the parameter value in the editor mode. I've tried to re-scan all audio units, but that didn't solve the problem. Any ideas? (OS X Catalina, iMac 2019)
 
As far as I understand, it is the old finger pointing game. Apple changes/updates something that requires the third-party developer to update their software (plugin). They give them prior notice to have it fixed by the release date. However, that works only in a perfect world.
 
In the case of Logic and Plugins, the end user can run into really annoying issues. For example, the developer didn't update in time, the developer refused to update (no time, no money, no interest), the developer doesn't exist anymore.
 
I emailed Waves about this the other day and they said that Waves is not yet supported by the newest version of Logic Pro X 10.5, and they're working on getting them all qualified for use. Kind of a bummer considering I live on the Waves stuff right now. I think one of the only options is to redownload an older version of OS to run an older version of Logic. Other than that, we might be SOL for the time being. I just hit them up on an ETA for the fix today so I'll come back once I get word of it.
 
All of my Waves plugins are V11. Yet every time I launch Logic I am prompted to move to trash or click cancel for plugins it says cannot be verified. I have over 400 Waves plugins and this is a true PITA! All of my UAD and IK Multimedia plugins are fine. After years of using Logic I am considering Pro Tools because this 10.5 issue really ruins my work flow before it even starts. These problems should have been addressed before launching. Especially seeing as a beta version was in the market.
 
In terms of tuning ability, again the task was very straightforward as with the other plug-ins covered in the series. It was not my intention to get too deep into all of the controls and features available within the programs. The idea for this series was to give a simple overview of what is possible if you wanted to do a bit of quick tuning of a vocal. I am however planning on doing more in-depth tutorials on each of the plug-ins which will cover in far more detail the controls available and how they can be used to shape a well tuned performance.
 
So take some time and have a look at this video along with the others in the series and you can make up your mind which one might well suit the way you work. They all do pretty much the same thing but in reality they there are differences in operation as well as in sonic outcome. As always do remember to like, comment and subscribe to my channel and stay tuned for further videos on this topic as well as other music production techniques particularly when working in Logic Pro X. Peace!

Astrophysicists using large radio telescopes to observe a collection of cosmic clocks in our Galaxy have found evidence for gravitational waves that oscillate with periods of years to decades, according to a set of papers published today in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The gravitational-wave signal was observed in 15 years of data acquired by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center (PFC), a collaboration of more than 190 scientists from the US and Canada who use pulsars to search for gravitational waves. International collaborations using telescopes in Europe, India, Australia and China have independently reported similar results.
 
While earlier results from NANOGrav uncovered an enigmatic timing signal common to all the pulsars they observed, it was too faint to reveal its origin. The 15-year data release demonstrates that the signal is consistent with slowly undulating gravitational waves passing through our Galaxy.
 
Observing so many pulsars requires a huge investment in people, infrastructure, and time. In 2004, a small group of astronomers carried out the first set of pulsar observations that would form the foundation for this work. For nearly two decades, the group has been growing in the number of people and diversity of expertise needed to perform this complex gravitational-wave search. Along the way, the NANOGrav collaboration took form, using the members' combined knowledge and skills to expand the data collection and improve the analysis.
 
Initially, pulsar instrumentation was not precise enough to achieve the sensitivity needed for this experiment. The team worked to develop next-generation instrumentation for both the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes. They scoured known pulsars to find those precise enough to enable the search for low-frequency gravitational waves and added them to the pulsar timing array. In parallel, there were advances in theory and breakthroughs in data-analysis techniques that are tuned and optimized for modern computing architectures.
 
Supermassive black holes are believed to reside at the centers of the largest galaxies in the Universe. When two galaxies merge, the black holes from each wind up sinking to the center of the newly-combined galaxy, orbiting each other as a binary system long after the initial galaxy merger. Eventually, the two black holes will coalesce. In the meantime, their slow inspiral stretches and squeezes the fabric of space-time, generating gravitational waves that propagate away from their origin galaxy like ripples in a pond, eventually reaching our own.
 
Detailed analysis of the background hum is already providing insights into how supermassive black holes grow and merge. Given the strength of the signal NANOGrav sees, the population of extremely massive black hole binaries in the Universe must number in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions.
 
The supermassive black hole binaries at the cores of galaxies produce electromagnetic waves at radio to gamma-ray wavelengths that can be detected by telescopes on Earth and in space. They also produce gravitational waves that can be studied through their effects on an array of radio pulsars. These dual electromagnetic and gravitational wave messengers provide extremely valuable insights that cannot be gleaned from either type of observation alone. Illustration: Olena Shmahalo
 
Future investigation of this signal will feed into scientists' understanding of how the Universe evolved on the largest scales, providing information about how often galaxies collide, and what drives black holes to merge. In addition, gravitational ripples of the Big Bang itself may make up some fraction of the signal,
