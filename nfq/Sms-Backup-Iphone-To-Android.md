I've recently changed my iphone to android phone and when I try to recover my Microsoft authenticator backup from ios to the android app it says "your backup is not stored with (my mail). Try signing in to a different personal Microsoft account". 
The thing is I'm signed with the same account on ios where the backup option is on and I can clearly see that there is a backup, but when I try to recover the backup on the android device it says that there's no backup on that same account!
 
Your backup is stored in the iCloud for iOS and in Microsoft's cloud storage provider for Android. This means that your backup is unavailable if you switch between Android and iOS devices. If you make the switch, you must manually recreate your accounts within the Microsoft Authenticator app.

You will see that Google Authenticator is even worst. 
I don't think that it's Microsoft the issue but Apple which not allowed to save the backup to a third party as they want you to stay on iOS 
There is no point for Microsoft not to let you save the backup in their Storage. If Apple blocks their eco-system is for one reason (iCloud only exist in Apple eco-system, iMessage, Apple Watch, Keychain, ...), it think there is only Apple Music which you can have a cross-platform with Windows and Android
 
I have the same issue. Apparently something is broken on MS side. Already tried 3 different accounts and got the same stupid message "your backup is not stored with" but on the old phone setting I see last backup stored within the account. Would be great if someone find a solution for this
 
My current set up for backups is iCloud managed accounts through Apple Business Manager, but the limit is 5GB per user i called Apple Business Support and they did not have any real solution then purchasing per account more iCloud Storage, which is sometimes not enough for the higher ups. I am in the market to Purchase a new MDM that has backup solutions either to server or cloud. iOS (Mandatory) and android compatible (But not needed)
