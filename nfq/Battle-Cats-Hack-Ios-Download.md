Every second, both sides will receive money they can use for two things: to improve the base or to buy troops. Your aim is to try to destroy the enemy base with the army that you create (out of cats of all sorts).

Between levels, you can unlock tons of new cats thanks to the experience you've gained. New cats are absolutely necessary since the first cats only have basic skills. Some of the special cats, though, can do devastating attacks on your enemies.
 
The Battle Cats is a strategy game with very simple game mechanics and simple-but-cute graphics. In addition, the game offers loads of one-player levels as well as scoreboards and a good handful of achievements.

Despite the seeming simplicity, The Battle Cats has quite a lot of complexity. There are 9 Normal Cats, the Special Cats, and many, many Rare, Super Rare, and Uber and Legend Rare Cats. There's over 300 Cats to choose from, most of them costing Cat Food, and hundreds upon hundreds of stages to test their strength on.
 
Examples from The Battle Cats POP! - Adaptational Wimp:
- The maximum level for Cats is 20, and only the Normal Cats have True Forms, so most of them are much weaker than in the mobile game.
- Many of the enemies from Stories of Legend are much less powerful here, to make up for the fact that the player is weaker as well. Some of the biggest examples are:
- Master A.: in addition to a drop in stats, he lost a lot of range, making him far less threatening than in the mobile game.
- Teacher Bun Bun is a brutal Wake-Up Call Boss in the original, in large part due to his non-stop attacks that will One-Hit Kill most Cats at that point in the game. Here, not only are his stats weaker, but his time between attacks is much longer, making it easy to overwhelm him. Note, however, that this only applies to the original; J.K. Bun Bun and Bun Bun Black have lost nothing.
- Adapted Out:
- The only Uber sets that appear are the Dynamites, the Vajiras, the Galaxy Gals, the Dragon Emperors, and the Ultra Souls, with Nekoluga as an added bonus. All the others are gone, even ones that were in the mobile game in 2016. Among said sets, only the first 5 Ubers to be added to each are present, so Nurse Cat, Kenshin, Kalisa, Dioramos, and Kachi-Kachi are gone.
- Alien enemies don't appear.
- There are no Stories of Legend chapters, so several enemies from there get left out.
- Anti-Frustration Features:
- To make up for Cat Food being non-purchasable, you get 1 every time you clear a stage for the first time, with duplicate treasures also giving some out.
- XP is much cheaper to buy with Cat Food, because there's no easy way to farm it like in the mobile game.
- Treasure Radars only cost 3 Cat Food instead of 45, so it's much easier to get any treasures you're missing.
- Arbitrary Headcount Limit: The game has one in the form of the Will bar. Said bar starts out full but lowers for every cat spawned in the field, with each cat having a different number that affects how much they drain out the bar. Once the Will bar is empty, you won't be able to spawn a new unit until a unit dies, which replenishes the bar by how much they drained it.
- The Artifact:
- Despite having no microtransactions (being a paid-for game), the game still has an energy system and Cat Food, which were both incentives to spend real money in the original.
- The presence of Valkyrie Cat, Bahamut, and Ururun Wolf. In the mobile game, Ubers are harder to come by, so they (and the other Legends) serve to help out players with bad luck or who don't want to spend real money. In POP!, however, Ubers are much easier to get in large quantities, so they serve little purpose. Valkyrie, already a Crutch Character in the mobile game, has little reason to be used here, and Bahamut and Ururun Wolf are only obtained when there are no stages left to use them on.
- Bragging Rights Reward: Once you beat the last story chapter of the game, you get Bahamut Cat the first time you beat the final stage and Ururun Wolf if you decide to challenge the stage again, though you only have a 3% chance of getting them, with both of them fulfilling the role of traditional backliner units. Thing is, by the time you get them, there are no more stages to challenge left to use them on.
- Camera Abuse: There's a chance that, when cats or enemies die, they get launched in front of the screen shortly before sliding down the screen, temporarily blocking your view of the battlefield in the process.
- Compressed Adaptation: Enemies from Empire of Cats, Stories of Legend, and some event stages are put into 3 new chapters, so many changes are made to accomodate them. Notably, the Cyclones just appear as regular bosses instead of getting their own unique stages, some enemies from monthly events show up, and the final boss is a tag team of J.K. Bun Bun and Bun Bun Black, followed by Ururun Wolf.
- Demoted to Extra: The Crazed Cats had their own unique stages to unlock them in the mobile game, but are just regular gacha Cats here. The same applies to the unlockable Rare Cats, the Bean Cats, Moneko, and Flower Cat.
- Early-Bird Cameo: The stages from Cats of the Cosmos appeared here before they did in the mobile game, though with completely different enemies.
- Infinity +1 Sword: The Crazed Cats, which are massively powerful compared to everything else in the game, can only be rolled from gachas when near the end of the last chapter.
- Player Vs Player: One of the port's features is the ability to take your Cats to do battle with other players.
- A Twinkle in the Sky: Sometimes when a cat or enemy dies, they get launched far into the background and disappear in a yellow star twinkle.
 
**Sniper the Cat:**Deploys a Cat in a hot-air balloon behind your base to attack the closest enemy to your base in the battlefield. Deals damage proportional to your Cat Base health.

 
Preface- Most of your Battle Cats data is saved on your device, so you can hack the game in 2 ways: Switch out the save file for a hacked one [Root required for Android, no Jailbreak required for iOS], or actively alter values in the app (which allows you to access unreleased content) [Root/Jailbreak required]. Since I am only familiar with the former, I can only discuss how to do that. If you want to perform the latter action, ask someone else who has done it before.

 
First, download a hacked save. For iOS, you will need a program that allows you to access your apps and data (ex: iFunBox). Find the Battle Cats and replace all the necessary files with the ones from the hacked save. Make sure the app is off before doing this. For Android, you just need a Rooted device and to replace the save file with the hacked one.

 
Congrats! You beat Chapter 1 and now are on Chapter 2! On this chapter, it will cost more cat energy to play missions, enemies are stronger, and cats will cost more to produce! However, the gameplay is the same as the Chapter 1, so you will need to conquer the world again and find treasures. Any Buffs you unlock in this chapter will stack with the Buffs from Chapter 1, so you will still need to get as many treasures as possible. Grind your way through to the final stage- the moon. Make sure you have as many treasures as possible, as they will make your life easier. User Rank is also unlocked in this chapter.

 
Completing a stage will unlock the next star difficulty (2 then 3). Star difficulties allow you to recomplete the subchapter at a higher difficulty (1.5x increased enemy strength magnification on 2-star and 2x increased enemy strength magnification on 3-star) and redeem 30 cat food upon completion.
 
These stages last for a month and have 8 or 6 stages. Beating each stage gives a chance at unlocking the event cat, each progressive stage giving a higher chance at obtaining the event cat. Using treasure tracker will unlock the event cat at any stage. And like all other subchapters, finishing the event stages will give you a one time 30 cat food bonus. Has 3-star difficulty enabled.

 
**The Ancients Arise: Take Back Earth!,**Into the Future Chapter 3 or simply Chapter 6, is the final chapter and conclusion(?) of Into the Future. It was added in version 3.5. and added even more alien versions of SoL and basic chapter enemies. Treasures are the same, and you will face Snail Bun Bun(?) at The Great Abyss, ? at Floating Continent, and Corrupted Bahamut at Moon. You will unlock the stupidly-high-DPS true form Bahamut Cat when finishing this chapter.

 
-Think of them as a better Paris Cat. Deals high damage, good health, area attack, and a bit more range than Paris. However, they have a longer cooldown. Useful in situations similar to Paris Cat, which is nearly every stage.
