Also, non-cell devices like iPad and iPod Touch will not allow a phone number in their settings in iMessage, so make sure on each device you use, as much information you can give it is entered. Also, if anyone is using multiple devices, it would be best to make sure the callerID on all of them is set to the same thing (email address) so that no matter what you are using it looks like the message is always coming from you and doesn't start a new iMessage thread on your recipient's iDevice.

First see in if her apple ID is linked with her iPhone phone number, if not, modify and save changes, then in her iPhone go to settings -> messages -> and deactivate iMessage and activate it again (the phone number should appear in "Receive At" greyed out). Do the same in settings -> FaceTime. After that reboot your iPhone. Hope that works, it worked for me ?

We've been using DropBox for many years to provide MD syncing between different users on their Macs as well as for the iOS app. My memory is that in order to get it working between different users, we just use the Dropbox website to "share" the appropriate folders between the various Dropbox accounts.
 
Is it possible to use iCloud Drive's folder sharing system to do the same thing that we have done with the Dropbox folder sharing? Perhaps Apple does not allow for the sharing between users for files stored in specific App folders such as the one used by MoneyDance, or maybe it is hard to get MoneyDance to navigate to the iCloud Drive location where shared files and folders end up being located when shared by another iCloud account. Does anyone know the details?
 
I recognize that this does not necessarily mean that MD can use this iCloud file sharing stuff for syncing between different iCloud users because MD might require some features that are not exposed through this file/folder sharing, but I have been using this feature to keep some password database files synced between various non-family-sharing individuals with different iCloud accounts for more than a couple of years now.

Where does MD store the syncing folder in iCloud? Is it in a MoneyDance specific folder on iCloud Drive? Is it a hidden or invisible folder named .moneydance like it is for Dropbox? If it is impossible to share invisible folders then I suppose this would be a non-starter.
 
I do use a mac, and sync to two other macs (with different apple ids), and sync to 2 ipads, 2 iphones (if I can ever read it... ;) ) and so on, but I also have a windows computer, and if it works with icloud for windows (this works for my outlook email), then I've just never found it worth pursuing, because Dropbox works for my system of devices.
 
The only unique thing about Dropbox for our usage right now is MoneyDance, and if I ever expand my accounting interactions with other members of my extended family, setting them up with new Dropbox accounts is something that I would prefer to avoid.
 
Maybe when I have something on my to-do list that I want to avoid doing, I will instead create a new MD account and see if I can dope out how it does the syncing using iCloud. If I can find the magic folders where things are stored I'll try sharing that and see what happens.
 
I had a corporate account with Apple; I setup all the phones using the same icloud account and deploy all the apps using Mass360; I marked the backup by foldername with the user name. No BYOD no personal photos allowed in those phones, in that way was a imply backup task.
