After getting quotes from companies to install some cameras we elected to purchase directly and self install. Installation was easy with the exception of climbing through the attic. LOL It is a very true plug and play system. Plug a new camera in and in a few seconds you are seeing it on your screen. Picture clarity is great
 
the system works but you really cant real time play the cameras and also the cameras only take footage for about 10 seconds. Also once the camera goes to sleep sometimes they wont up and the camera loses connection to the NVR. I will say that customer service has been helping me with my problems 100%.

DVR (Digital Video Recorder) systems are traditional camera surveillance systems using analog cameras, coaxial cables, and a DVR recorder. The analog cameras connect to the recorder through the coaxial cables, transmitting unprocessed video signals. Once the signals reach the recorder, they can be processed and made available for digital viewing.
 
DVR and NVR surveillance systems use different types of cameras, shaping how each system operates. DVR systems use analog cameras that connect to a DVR using coaxial cable. The video signals from the cameras are converted from analog to digital by the recorder.
 
NVR systems, on the other hand, use advanced IP, or internet protocol, cameras. These cameras can process video data themselves, instead of relying on the recorder to convert footage, allowing for wireless transmission.
 
If you have spotty internet, no internet, or Wi-Fi security concerns, a DVR system may be a better choice for you than a wired NVR system. DVR systems are dependable, affordable, and relatively straightforward. And, with recent advancements in analog high definition, the gap in quality between NVR and DVR systems has significantly lessened.
