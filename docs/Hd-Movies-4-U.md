Join us this summer to celebrate our 24th season of **Movies With A View Presented by Pluto TV!** Our free outdoor movies are shown on Thursday evenings in July and August, at Pier 1 Harbor View Lawn. **See the line-up below!**
 
There is no better place to be on a hot summer night than watching a classic film and enjoying the breeze off of the East River with the dazzling Manhattan skyline before you. Each evening, the lawn opens at 5:00 PM on a first come, first serve basis, and the movie begins at sunset. Enjoy a range of concessions and beverages for sale on site, along with our Bar by Fornino for those 21+ to enjoy.
 
No, all Movies With A View events are open to all ages. However, guardians should be aware that titles may include PG-13 and R rated selections, which are clearly noted. We encourage guardians to do their own research ahead of time to ensure the movie is suiting and appropriate for your children. Additionally, all minors should be accompanied by an adult. The Conservancy is not responsible for gauging appropriateness of titles for movie-goers.

Unfortunately, no to both. Chairs (other than wheelchairs) are not allowed on the lawn, so please bring your own picnic blanket. Portable stadium-style cushion seats without legs or hard pieces are a great option. Dogs are not allowed on the lawns at any time, per Park rules.
 
For those who require physical accommodations, there is a limited reserved seating area at the top of the lawn (on the hardscape). Please bring your own chair, and see a Conservancy staff member the welcome tent at top of the lawn to inquire.
 
Transportation Alternatives will once again be providing free bike valet services for moviegoers at the Pier 1 Turnaround lot off Furman Street. Movie goers may also use bike rack near the Pier 1 entrance. Bikes will not be allowed onto the lawn, and should not be locked to fences or other unauthorized areas.
