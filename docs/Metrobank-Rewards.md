Elevate your experience as a credit card user by learning all about the Metrobank credit card rewards program. Explore how you can earn points quickly, when you can redeem your rewards, and where you can enjoy the fruits of your labor.
 
The Metrobank credit card rewards program does exactly what it says on the tin: reward every Metrobank cardholder with freebies like gift certificates, exclusive discounts, and other exciting prizes from multiple partner merchants.
 
Note that although some Metrobank promos require you to meet an accumulated spend requirement to redeem certain rewards, points are still computed per transaction and not based on your overall purchases.
 
One way to earn credit card points quickly is to get a credit card with an accelerated rewards program or a great points multiplier. While the spend-to-point conversion of Metrobank is generally pretty decent, you can earn points a lot quicker if you use specific cards for specific purchases to double or triple your points on certain spend categories.

For example, the Metrobank Titanium Mastercard earns you double points on shopping and dining spend, while the Metrobank World Mastercard earns you double points on overseas spend. Take advantage of these point multipliers.
 
Aside from the gift certificates and rebates you can redeem with your Metrobank credit card points, you can also access exclusive Metrobank credit card promos to get the most out of your card. Usually, banks offer generous rebates and freebies during peak seasons, so always keep your eyes peeled for announcements!
