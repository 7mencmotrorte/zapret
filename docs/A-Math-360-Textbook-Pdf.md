Is solving all of the exercises in a textbook a good idea? I'm particularly concerned with textbooks on mathematics. I have this obsession that I should solve all of the problems that a textbook has. It takes a lot of time and energy but usually I'm satisfied with the end result being me having a better understanding of that particular subject.
 
It depends enormously on your personal objectives, apart from your personal predilections. For example, if a significant goal is to advance your understanding of mathematics, then obsessing over exercises (many of which are contrived busywork in undergrad textbooks, and sometimes in grad-level textbooks in the U.S.) is a dubious investment of your personal resources.
 
For one thing, apart from the articiality of some of the exercises, many of them will be semi-incomprehensible if you've just read the chapter they appear after... but obvious after you've read further! A significant reason for this is that mathematics has developed with various goals in mind, so that the most important enduring concepts and facts refer to important phenomena... not just to some artificial choice of linear logical development as is the common style in textbooks.
 
On another hand, if you do not aim to be a professional mathematician, or if somehow you have a lot of spare time, sure, why not do whatever you want? Indeed, another common trap of studying mathematics is being too obedient about following some syllabus or textbook, as opposed to following one's own curiosity and interests. It is subtler to parse the situation that your impulse is to do all the exercises... :)
 
Another practical point is that, at some point, probably soon, unless you severely restrict what books you look at, there's no way you'll have time to do all the exercises in detail, even if you are a whiz-kid. There are too many, and sometimes they are prankish. For example, the "exercises" in Atiyah-MacDonald's "Commutative Algebra" (a misleadingly slim volume) are mostly "theorems" one would find in other books on the same topic.
 
And, then, there's the point that novices' "solutions" to difficult exercises are often severely suboptimal, even if "successful". Sure, it's good to think about issues, but, at the same time, you'll be able to approach those questions far more wisely later (if you still care, and the things haven't become completely obvious anyway!).
 
But certainly no one is "required" to do all the exercises, despite some propaganda on the internet. For that matter, it is probably not optimal for most peoples' circumstances and goals. Still, taking an extreme stance, maybe the world will end tomorrow, and if you want to spend the evening doing exercises that you find enchanting, I'd be the last one to try to discourage you. :)

There is no right answer here, although you need to think about the time commitment involved. For instance, I doubt you need to solve every problem in an introductory calculus book. However, in a textbook where the number of problems per section or chapter is limited, it may be instructive to you to solve the problems that aren't assigned.
 
However, ultimately, this is a function of how you as an individual learn best. For some people, additional repetition of skills can help; for others, they can pick it up much more quickly, in which case the additional problems may not yield many benefits.
 
**No**, it's not. All questions are not equally good exercises. You'd be better served to purchase **2** books on the subject (ideally that take different approaches to the subject matter) and solve 1/2 the questions (picking out the better ones) in each text. This is of course contingent on wanting to learn a particular subject very thoroughly, and that solving questions helps you a lot. In many cases, it'd be a better use of your time to look at other related subject rather than spend so much time on one in particular, but I leave that to you.
 
Frankly, I can imagine few exceptions to this. The one that I can think of is that a text is very sparse in the questions is has and all the questions are good, but even then, you should evaluate a question's usefulness independently of others. A blanket policy like just doing all the problems in a text is very likely to to have a lot of redundancy in the problems you're solving. Textbooks aren't cheap, but there's a lot of material online nowadays as well if cost is an issue. If you're studying a field that's so small that there simply aren't many textbooks on the subject, chances are you'd be well served to read papers rather than textbooks.
 
As a student of mathematics, I like to state that none can learn mathematics without solving mathematical problems in hand. Exercises in textbooks are a collection of mathematical problems. A good book contains beautiful problems. When you are learning a branch of mathematics you must select a good book to solve its exercises as much as you can. Solving problems is more important than reading the text.
 
As a consequence of the CC license, your text will certainly be freely available on the web. Nevertheless, you want to publish the book at some reasonable price, say 20$. You presume that a student is willing to pay a reasonable price for a hard copy even if it is freely available on the net.
 
I have found createspace a good publisher for my book "Topology and Groupoids"; they are an amazon.com company, and this has the implication that the royalty rates are good (black and white, 6" x 9", 200 pages, price 20.00 dollars, gives $8.75 royalty). Non exclusive contract.
 
Later: Another disadvantage is that many libraries and institutes buy anything issued by a major publisher, but have to be persuaded to buy a book which does not have the cachet of having satisfied the refereeing process of a major publisher. The advantage of this amazon.com company is that the royalty is direct on the published price for amazon sales.
 
Later: I have found another problem, as a UK resident, namely that the USA Inland Revenue insists that 30% tax be deducted, as against the lowest UK rate of 20%, unless you can get a USA Income Tax Number allocated: in view of the difficulties I have had in doing this, I think you would need to employ a professional who knows all the ropes. However, this is a marginal problem in my case.
 
(1) It is not clear to me that you have no use for a publisher. Publishers work to promote your book to libraries, book stores and to faculty looking for a textbook. They also may be willing to pay you an advance on your future royalties, which would opportunity risk of missing other forms of income by writing a textbook. I also would not assume that book publishers would not provide useful editing if you wanted it. You might be interested in Cory Doctorow's thoughts on the benefits of working with traditional publishers. Doctorow is a fiction writer and essayist who distributes all of his work under a very permissive CC license. Fiction isn't textbooks, of course, but I think there are some interesting ideas here.
 
(2) If your goal is to print copies of a PDF file with no professional editing, Lulu has a good reputation for that sort of thing. I have no personal experience with them, and the people I do know who have experience were printing fiction and prose, not math, so take that for what it is worth.
 
(3) The obvious person for you to talk to Allen Hatcher. His Algebraic Topology textbook is freely available for download, but is also sold in hard copy by Cambridge University Press (and is very good!).
 
**Talk** to the AMS editors directly. I have a late (and dear) coauthor who has published many books and I published one with him. His experience was that scholarly society publishers are very open minded with regards to your copy-left/right needs. Basically, you'll be dealing with other scholars in mathematics who have published works, teach at a university ... and not middle management in a publishing house with an MBA degree (with all due respect to my students).
 
My experience with the AMS regarding copyright issues is very positive, though things are administratively chaotic (no updates on sales, no money--though I know for a fact that my mom bought six copies).
 
Cambridge University Press is perfectly willing to publish books which are also freely available on the web (at least in 99%-complete draft form). I'm not sure how far they'd go in terms of the most liberal Creative Commons license, but here are a couple of examples of it occurring:
 
You might try contacting Lon Mitchell at Virginia Commonwealth University. VCU has published hardcover versions of two open source textbooks (one on Linear Algebra, the other on Abstract Algebra), each costing under $20.
 
I run a web site, theassayer.org, which catalogs books whose authors have intentionally made them free. A surprisingly high percentage of such books are advanced math books, the other large category being computer manuals and computer science books. If you browse through the catalog, you can get an idea of what various people are doing: what licenses they're using, whether they sell the book in print, whether they're working with a traditional publisher or self-publishing.
 
My own experience is that \$20 is too high for my students. At that price, nearly all of them would prefer the free download. Students are cheap, and they will pu
