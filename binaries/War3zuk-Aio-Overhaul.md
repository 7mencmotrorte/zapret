What this Mod is about, This Mod changes around 90% of the Total game Mechanics in the sense of Code, It adds many weapons All of which have been bought from various stores to try to get the best looking and playing Mod he can manage, Its constantly being worked on and improved and should always be kept upto date with the latest version of the main core game, The AIO also adds many Blocks and Different items that require abit more learning in order to understand how it all works, A good example of this is the main weapons are no longer repaired using the default repair kits but instead use 4 Custom made varients that are crafted on the player to do with each type of gun. Some of His Original Modlets that were used to create this AIO are as follows. Around 20 or so more have been added directly to the AIO that cant be made into Modlets due to them needing certain bits of code from the AIO so would cause Conflicts. Thank you to the following Modlet creators who helped shape out the world with their modlets:
 
Included are around 20 or so Custom Prefabs of his own..WORLDS are Made using the Ingame Random Gen which uses a Modified Compo Pack RWGMixer file These Are Included In A Seprate Modlet So They Can Be Removed If Needed And Fall under the same Rules of agreement along with all Modlets starting with War3zuk.

Is it possible to make the wasteland dangerous because of radiation and there are special metals and special loot there, a lot of dangerous zombies with 30k health. And you need a protective suit to get there. And now metals are the same everywhere, there is almost no point in going to other biomes.
 
how can i uninstall this modpack? i couldnt get it to work so i uninstalled deleted local game files, deleted the registries, cleaned pc temp files and then reinstalled. then when i install another modpack it still says war3zuk-aio-overhaul on the main menu which is interfering with another modpack
 
If youre messed up your game installtion delete it using the games launcher in delete your installation files there, then deinstall it with steam and re-install it there with a fresh copy. dont forget du clean it all up with the gamelauncher.exe in the 7 days to die folder!
 
Early game is way too punishing with the current infection system. You require HD cures or forced to wait hours of IRL time for the infection to finally kill you and then it goes away, otherwise, you screw over players big time starting out, with no reasonable way to cure these infections.
 
forcing players to stay online and literally do nothing, unable to play, because their stats are reduced to one, is debilitating and game breaking imho. I can see why some folks would RQ over something like this, because your forcing IRL time to do nothing if they want to play.
 
I can understand the need for such powerful monsters in the late game to ensure the longevity of the game.
 But You should consider balance and whether players get a good experience when adding these enhancement mods , I think you need to think about whether players have enough ability to cope with the intensity of such a game before the resources are developed.Instead of just increasing the difficulty to torture players.

Some settings in the game prep tabs can help you out such as player experience percentage which can be turned way up to make you stronger faster. There is another tab where you can control the movement speed of all zombies in the game making them much slower. This overhaul is meant to be very difficult and you need to constantly be on the lookout and always leave yourself a way out. Do not get backed into a room or closet with no way out. If you are doing a quest inside a building and you hear a horde running up on the house you are in do not wait to see if they are gonna attack it assume they will and start looking for a way out. Above all do not allow yourself to get encumbered it is a death sentence.
 
The installation video is outdated and im a bit of an idiot so i seemed to have screwed up the install something royal and I cant get it to work, Is there a more updated install tutorial around that might help?
 
After reading the comments below, here is my take on this mod. First and foremost I am enjoying it a great deal. Some small issues but nothing worth getting annoyed about. It is obviously still a work in progress and as long as you treat it as such, giving the mod-ers clear and respectful feed back will work in your favour. (Yes I am Canadian so if you do not like how we spell things get over it. grin.)
 
Ich find es schade das man so eine mod so verschlimmert hat besonders der spawn der Zombies in dem hordenbase Gebude ist unmglich .Und dann noch diese Leute die einen abschieen wollen ohne Grund ist echt tzend
 
got every skill/recipe to max and i am still unable to craft a lot of the items even though the pre-requisite says it allows the craft of it (yes i know you cannot craft some items but there are too many items bugged or have no way to craft even though it is not listed as uncraftable)
 
they changed how to add mods to game
 Launcher on Windows now stores log files in %APPDATA%/7DaysToDie/logs folder
 Screenshots are stored in UserDataFolder/Screenshots (i.e. the folder that also stores saves, e.g. on Windows APPDATA/7DaysToDie/Screenshots)
 Mods are now loaded from UserDataFolder/Mods (i.e. the folder that also stores saves, e.g. on Windows APPDATA/7DaysToDie/Mods) in addition to game folder/Mods. In a future build this will change to only load from that new location so no data is written/changed in the program folder at any time
 
I really love this mod.
 I had no big error and problem right now.
 But had just one problem that .44 desert vulture sound replaced by HD dragunov sound
 i would prefer vanilla much more and dragunov silence and normal sound got reversed
 
I just updated the game, installed this mod and it crash the whole computer 2 times in a row.
 No error, nothing, just froze the game and a couple seconds later it restarted.
 1st was during the game, while I was clearing a building of zombies, during the 1st night.
 2nd crash was while I was loading the map on the world editor to see where the hell I was related to the cities. No other mods running aside from a couple of config modifications I did myself, so I know its not messing up with anything that could possibly cause a crash.
 
Sorry for my bad english
 I am using the 4.4 version of modpack. If I update this version to the current version, do I know where I left off in my save file or do I need to open a clean save?
 In addition, I get an error when I go out of 1 or 8 while navigating the hot bar with a mouse ball. Is there a solution to this in the game or is it a problem due to the mod?
 Error :
 
From what i have found , it means your codes have some content missing. like there is a bracket that wasnt closed or a ; out of place. i would go into to the game files and see where it may be causing the error. alot of the time its the computer downloading the data wrong or the Vanilla pack forcing the mod code to change. Hope this helps!
 
hi, firstly great work.
 i only have a really small issue and that is when bag is opened the author name is written next to inventory!
 where would i have to look to edit this out as it just appears as a smudge of white writing?
 
Hello, I just wanted to know is there a way I can get rid of the spiders in the game, it might sound stupid but I have arachnophobia and it would make the game much more fun if they were not in my game, thank you!
 
Hope your ok with digging through the XML files. If you are, do to steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\War3zuk-Alpha-19-Stable-AIO-master.zip\War3zuk-Alpha-19-Stable-AIO-master\Config or wherever you stored your copy of the game, and in the config folder use Notepad++ or whatever program you use, scroll and find the giant spider and just delete it, it will remove the chance for spawning from the game, but keep the spiders in game so not to mess with the rest of the files. Cheers
 
What about if I only want a few mods of that list?
 Can I just dl the one I want and place it in the mods folder of my server, separately?
 Another thing, will it work properly if I already use Robertolo zombies, butcher mod, bigger backpack from Kain?
