This is a late Upanishad exclusively devoted to the Hindu god Rama,[4] dated to have been composed in the modern era.[5] The text is largely recited by Hanuman, who states that Rama is identical to the supreme unchanging reality Brahman, same as major Hindu deities, and the means to satcitananda and liberation.[6][7] The text also includes sections on Tantra suggesting the Bīja mantra based on Rama.[6]

Neither the author nor the date of composition of this text is known. Moriz Winternitz makes a passing mention in a footnote stating that it belongs to the same period as the other Rama-related Upanishads.[6]
 
Not much is known about this text, states Ramdas Lamb, and it is to a large extent different from the other Rama-related Upanishads.[8] The *Ramarahasya Upanishad*, along with the *Rama tapaniya Upanishad*, presents Rama as an avatar of Vishnu, and these are therefore classified as Vaishnava Upanishads.[9] The Christian missionary in colonial British India, Farquhar included it in the list of 123 Upanishads.[6] The Vedanta philosophy had a major influence on this and other Rama-related Upanishads, states Lamb, along with the 12th century Rama-related *Agastya Samhita* text.[6]
 
In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 54.[10] The Upanishad is not part of the anthology of 52 popular Upanishads in north India by Colebrooke, nor is it found in the *Bibliotheca Indica* anthology of popular Upanishads in south India by Narayana.[11]
 
The narration of the text is presented as replies by Hanuman to the questions posed to him by many rishis seeking true knowledge.[6][13] Hanuman states god Rama is the supreme reality, the Brahman and the Atman (soul), and he is the medium to attain moksha or emancipation.[3] The text presents goddess Sita, the wife of Rama, as the cause of creation, and Hanuman as the completely absorbed example and ideal devotee of Rama.[14] Together, Rama and Sita are asserted to be the source of all existence.[15]
 
Rama is, asserts the text, same as other major Hindu deities.[6] The other divinities mentioned in the text, states Dalal, as *angas* (aspects) of Rama are Ganesha, Surya, Chandra, and other avatars of Vishnu (Narayana, Narasimha, Vasudeva, Varaha).[12] The characters of the Hindu epic Ramayana such as Lakshmana, Shatrughna, Bharata, and Vibhishana are also asserted by the text to be aspects of Rama.[12] The Upanishad adds that goddesses such as Saraswati (the goddess of learning) and Durga (a fierce form of Mahadevi) are manifestations of Rama, the supreme truth and reality, symbolized as the Pranava (Om).[12]
 
Hanuman advocates the importance of reciting the six syllabled Rama Mantra, *Rama Ramaya namah*. In section 1.13, states Lamb, Hanuman informs Vibhishana that constant recitation of the *Ramanama* (Rama's name) mantra removes the bad karma of a person accrued from committing the sin of killing his father, his mother, his guru, or a Brahmin.[6] The text also recommends the reading of the Rama Gita.[12]
 
The Upanishad text has verses that relate to dhyana or the contemplation of Rama.[12] The text, states Dalal, asserts that the "rahasya" or secret of "energising the body" (Nyasa) is to recite Rama mantra it discloses while touching different body parts.[12]

Tantra tells you the problems and fixes the things too. Tantra also leads to Self-realization. Jyotish too is a Vidya, it leads to self-illumination and Ramal Shastra is very much a part of this. Every Yog or Vidya or Shastra has an associated Tantra or it is not of much use. You have the machine/ yantra, the knowledge/ mantra by you need to know the process/ tantra in order to achieve your goal.
 
These 16 images, the Shakal शकल , made me want to learn Ramal Shastra. These are the 16 forms of the Moon/ Chandra. Each form of the Moon is called a Chandra-kala, this lasts for one day and this day is called a Tithi. So each Shakal is in fact the conscious intelligence of the Tithi or the Kala. These Kala कला are a part of Shri Vidya, the knowledge of your own internal energy geometry. These 16 images give Ramal its tantric identity. **Ramal Shastra is Tantra.**
 
(I had got a question on Ramal Jyotish some time ago but was putting off writing this post as I did not know how much I would be allowed by karma to write on this topic. So this post is a bit disjointed.)
 
Dear Madam,
It was by serendipity that I stumbled onto your blog. Thank You!
Can you kindly write about praying for others especially in the pandemic times,
how can it be done effectively?Thanks in advance.
 
we common householders do pujas for our family.
before you do any puja you take a sankalp. if you have participated in a formal puja/yajnya etc the brahmin would have made you take the sankalp.
take a few drops of water on your right palm, say out aloud what you intend from this puja, and let the drops fall to the ground.
the entire success of any puja/mantra/homa/etc depends on this sankalp.
so if you wish to do a mantra/puja etc for the entire world, simply take such a sankalp. in any language you are comfortable in, say that you are doing this puja for the benefit of the world.
and then do a 108 time chanting of any Bhagwan Vishnu mantra. Or recite the Vishnu sahastranama once, or recite the Dhanvantari mantra, or whichever mantra you feel like will help the world.
