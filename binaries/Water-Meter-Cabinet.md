The enclosures are manufactured withlong-life viewing windows for clear visibility of the meters installed internally. The size and number of windows can becustomized to suit any requirement. Certified to the standards of the Power and Water utility authorities, meteringenclosures/cabinets find usage as housing for water consumption and flow meters for individual residential andcommercial properties.
 
Founded in 1989 in the United Arab Emirates with a mission to manufacture composite solutions in glass reinforced polyester materials for the industrial sectors of power, water and oil & gas. The staple of the GRP product range are our weatherproof enclosures and kiosks which offer the highest classification of protection outdoors.

**We have mainly adapted our APM and ART boxes and cabinets for the Water Industry, in addition to developing other models of boxes and cabinets specific to that demand. We do a stainless steel chassis for water meters or polyester boxes with the size you need for irrigation. We are developing control panels for pumping stations and irrigation.**
 
It started out when the water bill seemed higher than it should be, and I wanted to know why.Unfortunately, even with their "smart" meter, the water company's reporting was at best, daily. This didn't really help me figure out what was using all of the water.
 
My first thought was to possibly capture the transmissions used for automatic meter reading with an SDR (software-defined radio).Unfortunately, after looking into it a bit, it looked like by default the meter only reported every hour.In addition, it looked like there was some non-trivial encoding being done on the signal, which would have made it a lot more work than I was hoping for.
 
Next up, I knew some power meters have an IR LED to report usage; however, I couldn't find one anywhere on the meter.This left me with adding another meter in-line after the water company's, but most of the ones I could find were upwards of $200.Since I was hoping to keep my budget under $50, this was a non-starter.
 
At this point, all I had was a stream of field strengths in LSb (with Gain=1, 1090 LSb = 1 Gauss), but it did oscillate with water usage so I knew I had it.The faster the oscillation, the more water being used.After collecting the data for a day, the numbers seemed to bottom out at -928 LSb (-853.76 mG) and top out at -328 LSb (-301.76 mG).To make things easier, I mapped that to -300 LSb and 300 LSb.Lastly, I grabbed a 1L bucket and counted how many oscillations it took to fill it. This gave me an oscillation/liter ratio, which I could use to convert all future data into liters or gallons.
 
Let's do the time warp again.The year is 2015 and the successor to the Spark Core, the Particle Photon is sitting on my front porch, waiting to change the world of water metering forever!Okay, I might be overdoing it a little, but I was excited.

The Spark Core and the Photon are supposed to be interchangable so I dug out the old circuit, swapped the two chips, and uploaded the old code.The good people at Particle didn't lie. Things worked and I had a way to monitor the data, but I needed a way to collect and store it.I'd been looking into time series databases over the summer, and I was eager to try one of them out. Meet InfluxDB.
 
I figured I'd do something along the lines of having the Photon read the data, send it to some collection node with MQTT, and then store it in InfluxDB.The Spark Core and Photon still seem to struggle with MQTT, though, so I instead opted to skip that step entirely.InfluxDB has an HTTP API, and the Photon can make HTTP requests, so I just had to combine the two, and the rest is history.It also conveniently interfaces extremely well with Grafana.
 
After all that, I did end up finding out what was using all of the water.It turns out, one of the underground drip lines in my garden had cracked over the winter and sprung a leak.It was using just slightly more water than it was supposed to, but when run for hours every week, it added up to be quite a lot.
 
Currently, I'm just enjoying being able to pull up the Grafana dashboard and see when I flush the toilet or take a shower.Sure, I kind of already know when I do those things, but now I can see their impact. Exactly how much water was used, how much it cost me, etc.Since InfluxDB has its own querying language, I'm also able to generate statistics like weekly usage, highest day or hour of usage, or compare how much water various settings on the washing machine use.It's pretty empowering and pretty cool.
 
I read a paper a few years back of some researchers using neural networks and an electric meter to identify the device using power from its "usage signature".Maybe instead of logging in and looking at the graphs, it could push a notification to my phone that someone has been taking a rather excessive shower or in my case, the drip system is using too much water.
 
After seeing this, my brother asked me if I could do the same for his natural gas meter so that'll probably be the next project.I think it'd be neat to have this sort of monitor for all of our utilities.Who knows what sort of information could be teased out of the data then?

A **water meter cabinet** is often made of stainless steel water, which is one of the most common materials and has a moisture-free function. They are made of stainless steel water meter cabinets, or called water meter cabinets for sale.
 
Water meter cabinets are essential to a one-of-a-kind things, a **water meter cabinet**, or water meter cabinets. They can be made from different materials, plastic, and glass elements, and as a means of keeping all of water meter items and, in the form of a water meter cabin, called water meter cabinets, or water meter cabinets.
 
The product is delivered fully assembled in a cabinet with 16 mm press fittings for tap water and PEM 32 mm for incoming water and 20 mm press fittings to and from the heater. All connections can be easily adapted if needed.
 
Water meter cabinets are typically used in villas, apartment buildings and apartments where incoming water meters are to be installed. In addition to the water meter console, the water meter cabinets also contain cold water manifolds with up to 11 outlets and hot water manifolds with up to 8 outlets.
 
During installation, incoming water is connected directly in the cabinet to the pre-assembled PEM connection. Then connect the outgoing cold water loop to the heat source, the heated water is then connected to the hot water manifold in the cabinet. Finally, distribute cold and hot water to the home's taps.
 
KROHNE metering systems for produced water are tailored to the needs of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) inlets and outlets. Whether it be contaminated water from oil wells or from other industrial sites: The metering skids are the key to clear and consistent billing procedures in accordance with custody transfer regulations. All water quantities are accurately measured, allowing the WWTP operator to precisely determine all the produced water loads received and processed.
 
KROHNE takes full project responsibility for the metering systems. The produced water skids come completely assembled and tested with calibrated electromagnetic flowmeters (e.g. the OPTIFLUX 2300), inlet and outlet piping, isolation valves, metering control cabinets with flow computers and supervisory system for monitoring, reporting and validation. KROHNE metering systems are often designed as a master-duty or Z-configuration, where a cross-over allows periodical verification of the duty meters against the master meter. In this way, maximum performance and lowest measurement uncertainty is guaranteed.
