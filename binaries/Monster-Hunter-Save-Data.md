I was modding some weapon data through cheat engine such as dmg and adding extra slots to certain weapons, and got locked out of my save file, with the "detected an incorrect value in save data" error.
 
@Hanusaur What you need to do is do the initial setup in the full game as if you didn't have save data (such as press create when it says no save data detected, sort out brightness and privacy settings) until you reach the title screen. Then at the title screen it'll have 4 options of which the bottom one allows you to transfer save data from the demo.

When **Monster Hunter Wilds** launches in 2025, returning players from Monster Hunter World will have some bonus content to check out. Monster Hunter Wilds is the next main series entry in the long-running and hugely successful Monster Hunter franchise. While Monster Hunter Rise was certainly popular, Monster Hunter Wilds is targeting newer hardware specifically, which should make it feel like more of a proper follow-up to Monster Hunter World.
 
Monster Hunter Wilds was first revealed at The Game Awards 2023 in a stunning trailer that, while impressive-looking, confirmed very little about the game. Now Capcom has given fans a much better idea of what they can expect from Monster Hunter Wilds come 2025, thanks to a new gameplay trailer revealed at the latest PlayStation State of Play event.
 
The Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay trailer showcases a huge graphical leap forward from Monster Hunter World, with significantly more detailed environments, monsters, and characters. The trailer shows Monster Hunter Wilds beasts that players will have to hunt, including a pack of bear-like monsters and an armored frog of sorts. As in previous games, Monster Hunter Wilds will have the monsters fighting each other occasionally, and players can also battle its fearsome creatures in co-op with friends. It remains to be seen exactly how co-op will work in the new game, but it does look like Monster Hunter World's SOS flares are making a comeback.
 
Speaking of Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Wilds will be doling out bonuses for those returning from that game. Those that have save data for Monster Hunter World will get the Felyne Leather Armor Set and the Felyne Acorn Spade Weapon. Those that have a save file for the Monster Hunter World: Iceborne expansion will additionally receive the Felyne Duffel Armor Set and Felyne Trekker Peckaxe Weapon.
 
Based on what's been shown so far, Monster Hunter Wilds is primed to be a big hit with fans of the franchise. Monster Hunter World was a massive success for Capcom and is indeed the company's best-selling game to date. Capcom clearly made a ton of new Monster Hunter fans with that entry, and so it will be hoping to bring them back for Monster Hunter Wilds. 2025 is shaping up to be an amazing year for gaming, and if huge new releases like Monster Hunter Wilds manage to stick the landing, next year should live up to the incredible hype and then some.
 
The Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate Data Transfer Program allows you to link up both the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U versions of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and transfer your save data between the two. This allows you to play on Wii U then continue your game on Nintendo 3DS, and vice versa.
 
After save data has been transferred from Wii U to Nintendo 3DS, the save file on Wii U will be temporarily locked, preventing you from progressing in the game using this save file. Once you have transferred your save data back from Nintendo 3DS to Wii U, you will be able to continue playing your save file on Wii U.
 
After save data has been transferred from Nintendo 3DS to Wii U, the save file on Nintendo 3DS will be deleted. Once you have transferred your save data back from Wii U to Nintendo 3DS, you will be able to continue playing your save file on Nintendo 3DS.

Monster Hunter World: Iceborne was just launched on PC last week, easily climbing on to Steam's top 10 concurrent players online. While the majority of players have had a stress-free launch experience, a sizeable number of players had problems with the game. This ranges from performance issues, where beefy PCs are dropping to single frames, to technical issues, where players can't even launch the game. However, the worst problem of all seems to be one player dread the most: Save file deletion.
 
The cause of save file deletion is still unknown at this point. Some players are speculating that it might have to do with very old save files not being updated before Iceborne's launch. Old players who have not logged in for some time and have only restarted Monster Hunter World because of Iceborne could be greeted with the following prompt:
 
Picking "yes" would overwrite the save file and create a new, Iceborne compatible save file. This would overwrite the current Monster Hunter World save file on the PC, leading to the old file's deletion. Right now, it is possible to recover the old save file, provided that it was saved in Steam's Cloud. However, if the game was quit and the save file was synced, then it is possible that the old save file could not be recovered anymore.
 
For those who unfortunately got hit by this huge oversight, we've compiled a way for you to recover your old save file (assuming it's still not deleted either locally or through the cloud) and convert it to be Iceborne compatible.
 
First, find your old save file. You can find this in "[Steam install folder]\user data\[Your Steam ID]\582010\remote\SAVEDATA1000". If you don't know what your Steam ID is, take a look at this post from Steam.
 
If you've already overwritten it locally, it might be possible to download your old save file, provided it was uploaded before the Iceborne patch. You can find it on =582010. Download these files to your PC.
 
Using the interface, Drag, and drop your character to the left. Then choose file>Save Save data and
