Hardened, high-performance Digi IoT solutions for the industrial space include industrial cellular routers, transportation cellular routers as well as wireless SOMs, embedded RF modules and Digi Remote Manager - the remote device management platform to monitor and manage device networks of any size and perform out-of-band management from a desktop or mobile device.
 
For any IoT device deployment of more than a few devices, teams deploying IoT solutions need a remote management system to support configuration, monitoring, security, firmware updates, troubleshooting and out-of-band management. Digi RM is the command center for your device network, providing the tools for configuring and managing your devices.
 
The need for IoT products is on a growth trajectory, encompassing everything from wireless IoT solutions such as embedded system-on-modules and RF modules to cellular routers and gateways. Digi is a leading provider of IoT products and solutions supporting industries from retail and banking to medical, transportation and remote industrial applications.

Defining the needs for wireless IoT solutions is a complex process, as are the subsequent phases, which include prototyping, designing, certifying, configuring and deploying your IoT application. Digi provides IoT services to support the complete lifecycle of product ideation, development, and management of IoT embedded designs as well as deployment of packaged solutions.
 
FirstNet is a nationwide, interoperable, broadband wireless network that delivers pre-emptive voice, text and data for first responders and critical infrastructure, even in times of large-scale public emergencies.

Precision levelling and tilt angles measurement essentially involve simultaneous 2-dimensional planes rather than conventionally known as two independent single-axis. Digi-Pas 2-axis intelligent inclination modules having high precision and wide measurement range are capable of providing real-time levelling, angular & vibration readings that empower application engineers to continuously measure and monitor machine/equipment/structure angular positional status precisely and speedily.
 
These small footprint, 2-axis and high shock resistant MEMS driven inclination sensor modules effectively eliminate limitations associated with using multiple single-axis sensors or bulky pendulum/servo-based sensors to achieve precise 2D levelling and planar angular measurements. MEMS sensor contents no moving part, essentially requires little/no maintanance when compared to pendulum-based sensor.
 
Precision machines/equipment performances are sensitive to its own frame/structure vibration. Unleveled machine footings is one definitive source enabling additional vibrations during machine is in running mode. For examples, (i) blur images in image/optical capturing machines (such as CMM, CT Scan & MRI) deteriorate measurement accuracy, (ii) Vibration causes CNC machines reduces production output yield. Typical machine's structural/frame vibrations are low frequencies. It is therefore vital to measure machine's vibration frequency and magnitude during machine running to manage its accuracy performances.
 
PC Sync PRO software can capture vibration patterns from Sensor module and real-time display on PC screen in graphical format. User may choose to save vibration data in Excel file for further analysis.
 
Digi-Pas 2-axis inclination sensor module system (Sensor Module + Control Box + PC Sync Pro Software) is designed as a DEVELOPMENT KIT for application engineers who explore to integrate sonsor modules into precision machine/equipment/structure enabling them to instantly access angular positional readings and store data in Excel format, without the need for tedious and time-consuming programming.
 
The angular measurement system enables user-defined settings to activate/control any external connected peripheral devices at ease (see below suggested diagram). Alternatively, highly experienced engineers/experts in sensors applications may use their own Low-level Programming codes to directly extract measurement readings from sensor module(s) **WITHOUT the need for using Control box and PC Sync Software (i.e. Development Kits)**. Users can download Digi-Pas **Dynamic-Link Library** to integrate with their own higher level programming codes to access sensors via Control Box. However, we strongly recommend FIRST-TIME users of the sensor module to utilize the development kit. Once familiarized with the system, users may proceed to remove the development kit leaving the sensor(s) directly connected to user's application codings and user's own hardware system.
 
DWL-5000XY Series Inclination Sensor Modules accuracy is verified by accredited 3rd party independent calibration & test bodies and National Metrology Centre traceable to SI standard and NIST, JIS, UKAS & DIN under CIPM MRA.
 
Precision levelling and angle measurement/alignment tasks essentially involve surface planes that demand for 2-dimensional solution rather than the outdated single-axis 'bubble' vial method that indicates 'bubble' leveling status 'one axis at a time'.
 
Digi-Pas 2-axis precision digital level simultaneous displays of two-dimensional plane angles, effectively simplifying and resolve the hurdles of taking angles 'one axis at a time' iteration (tedious & time consuming task of trial-and-error) experienced when using those outdated single-axis 'bubble' or traditional digital levels to conduct surface plane levelling, tilt angle measurement, surface flatness profiling and precision 2D alignment tasks.
 
The goal was to encourage and support a reflection on institutional strategy development and enhancement, through good practice sharing and peer learning among university leadership, and to contribute to community building. The coincidence of the Covid-19 crisis made these activities even more pertinent and urgent.

Digitalisation is of growing importance at all higher education institutions. Studies confirm increased general acceptance of digital learning and a growing trend towards more strategic and mainstreamed use. This entails the integration and scale-up of learning and teaching innovation, which usually emerges bottom-up, and a gradual transformation of the institution. It requires leadership, participatory approaches and investment in order to establish well-functioning digital learning ecosystems that serve the entire institution and all members and stakeholders and that are able to respond to change. (Trends 2018, p. 60; Changing Pedagogical Landscapes 2018; Digitally enhanced learning and teaching in European higher education institutions, 2021).
 
The DIGI-HE project aims to support these processes, by gathering data and information on the strategic development of digitalisation and organising peer learning for knowledge and experience sharing among institutional leadership from across the European Higher Education Area.
 
The validation conference in Brussels (24 January 2023) gathered a mixed audience of institutional representatives, policy makers and any other stakeholder with an interest in digitalisation in higher education. The institutions that participated in the thematic peer groups shared their experience and presented the impact their involvement in the thematic peer groups has had at their institution. Also, as part of the conference, small breakout sessions and workshops on thematic issues are planned.
 
When teaching, and when talking to clients, I sometimes have to explain the security problems related to DNS zone transfer. The problem usually comes when trying to demonstrate how it works and what information can be leaked, trying to remember which domains have zone transfer enabled and then hoping that they still have it turned on can make it hard. So, to ease both of these problems I've registered zonetransfer.me, a domain which is easy to remember and which will always have zone transfer enabled.
 
So, the domain is zonetransfer.me and the two name servers are nsztm1.digi.ninja and nsztm2.digi.ninja. Feel free to use this domain in your training and when talking to clients, hopefully it will help educate people as to why it should be disabled in almost all cases on public DNS servers.
 
What security information can we gather from this? There are two bits I would say could be useful, the responsible person field gives an email address which could be used as part of other attacks, and from the current serial number, if it is date based and checked regularly, a change could indicate some activity in the company.
 
The name servers for this domain. It is always worth checking for zone transfers on all available name servers, I've seen a number of clients with multiple servers where, for an unknown reason, a single server has zone transfer enabled. You can also look for differences in output which may leak useful information.
