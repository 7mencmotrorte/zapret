The Authorized Equipment List consists of 21 equipment categories, further divided into sub-categories and individual equipment items. Note that this list only includes equipment types, not commercially available products.

The Interagency Board provides subject matter expertise on equipment used by first responders and other emergency management professionals. They maintain the Standardized Equipment List (SEL), which has most of the equipment types listed on the Authorized Equipment List.

CGMIX remains the official site of available type approved equipment; however the copies provided on this page will allow people to see the certificate in its entirety, including appendices and previous versions. The date columns give the dates from the most recent revision, not the original certificate. Any inquiries regarding BWMS equipment and operating limitations should be directed to the manufacturer.
 
Coast Guard engineers evaluate the design features of the device and the laboratory's test report. If the device passes the tests and meets all of the other requirements, the Coast Guard issues a formal approval certificate with a number that the manufacturer will affix to each approved device of the same design. After a design is formally approved, the manufacturer conducts certain production inspections and tests to make sure that production runs of approved items continue to meet the requirements for the device that was originally approved. The Certificate of Approval is valid for five years, and the approval will be listed on the Coast Guard Marine Information Exchange (CGMIX).
 
If the manufacturer changes any part of an approved item, the Coast Guard evaluates the changes before they are included in any device which is claimed as Coast Guard approved. Sometimes, this means that additional testing is required.

There is presently no charge by the U. S. Coast Guard for issuing a certificate of approval. However, all costs at the testing laboratory for testing and for any factory follow-up inspections are the responsibility of the applicant. Where the Coast Guard supervises tests and inspections outside the United States, the applicant must agree to reimburse the Coast Guard for the travel and subsistence expenses of the inspector.
 
NIJ has released an update to the ballistic resistant body armor standard along with the a new specification for NIJ ballistic protection levels and associated test threats. Here is what you need to know.
 
Most importantly, keep wearing the armor you have now. NIJ will continue to maintain its current list of armor that has already been certified to the previous standard for several years, so that manufacturers and agencies can transition to armor that meets the new standard. Given the large number of ballistic-resistant vests currently worn by law enforcement officers, the NIJ Compliance Testing Program anticipates maintaining the 0101.06 Compliant Products List through at least the end of calendar year 2027.
 
In early 2024, the NIJ Compliance Testing Program will stop accepting new armor models for testing under the old version of the standard. Behind the scenes, the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) will use NIJ Standard 0101.07 to accredit ballistics laboratories and, in spring 2024, the program will begin testing, evaluation, and certification of ballistic-resistant body armor to the updated standard. Law enforcement agencies should expect to see body armor certified by NIJ to the 0101.07 standard sometime in late 2024 or early 2025.
 
NIJ certifies torso-worn ballistic resistant body armor for law enforcement that complies with the requirements the NIJ Compliance Testing Program (NIJ CTP). The following table presents the list of compliant ballistic-resistant body armor. (Find compliant stab resistant and combo armor.)
 
Note that NIJ has never tested nor certified ballistic items, such as backpacks, blankets, or briefcases, other than body armor for law enforcement. See DOJ Statement on Claims of NIJ Certification of Ballistic Backpacks.
 
As part of the certification process, data is generated to demonstrate compliance with federal regulations. The data provided below represents information that is most commonly requested. Within each industry, data is separated into current and archived legacy files.
 
For Model Year 2011, Large NRSI data can be found in both files listed below. MY 2011 certification data not found in one file will be located in the other. This is due to a transition in our database system.
 
For Model Years 2007-2009, Locomotive data can be found in both files listed below. MY 2007-2009 certification data not found in one file will be located in the other. This is due to a transition in our database system.
 
For Model Year 2011, Marine SI data can be found in both files listed below. MY 2011 certification data not found in one file will be located in the other. This is due to a transition in our database system.

New York State Public Health Law 2802-b Health Equity Impact Assessments (HEIA) went into effect on June 22, 2023. Certificate of Need (CON) applications submitted beginning June 22, 2023, by certain Article 28 facilities must include the HEIA documents in addition to previously required CON schedules. For more information on the requirement, go to the Health Equity Impact Assessment site.
 
New York's Certificate of Need (CON) process governs establishment, construction, renovation and major medical equipment acquisitions of health care facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, home care agencies, and diagnostic and treatment centers.
 
The objectives of the CON process are to promote delivery of high quality health care and ensure that services are aligned with community need. CON provides the Department of Health oversight in limiting investment in duplicate beds, services and medical equipment which, in turn, limits associated health care costs.
 
The packing list identifies items in the shipment and includes the net and gross weight and dimensions of the packages in both U.S. imperial and metric measurements. It identifies any markings that appear on the packages, and any special instructions for ensuring safe delivery of the goods to their final destination.
 
If cargo is lost or damaged, a packing list is required to file an insurance claim, and it is also used if there is a disagreement between the carrier and the exporter regarding the weight or measurement of the cargo.
 
More and more companies are foregoing the time-consuming process of relying on expensive courier services or taking the time to hand-deliver a certificate of origin to a chamber of commerce for certification and are relying on electronic certificates of origin (eCO) for their shipments. An eCO is often quicker to turn around, allows you the option of delivering the certificate electronically to the importer, and can be registered with the International Chamber of Commerce to provide added credibility.
 
In addition to the generic certificate of origin form, there are also country-specific certificates of origin. The United States currently has signed 14 free trade agreements with 20 different countries in which U.S. goods are eligible for reduced or zero duty rates when imported into those countries. Some free trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the United States-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), cover multiple countries, including the U.S. In our article When to Use a Certificate of Origin Form for Your Exports, you'll find links to country-specific certificates.
 
Typically, the importer is responsible for claiming preferential duty rates, but the producer or exporter of the goods is the one most likely to know whether or not their goods qualify. Therefore, they are often the party that completes the certificate.
 
I often describe the SLI as a cover memo for your other export paperwork. Depending on whether or not the forwarder works for you, the SLI may include a limited Power of Attorney, providing authority to act on your behalf for this shipment. Learn more about how to fill out an SLI here.
 
Depending on who hired the forwarder, the SLI may also grant the forwarder permission to file the export information electronically through the Automated Export System (AES). Most exports valued at more than $2,500 per item must be submitted to customs via AES, which makes filing through AES an important consideration for many exporters.
