Thank you for providing your device information, as that is incredibly helpful. Other than that, can you provide any other details about when this occurs? I know it may feel random, but please try to note if it happens in particular levels or after you've done a certain action. You mentioned stickman being uncontrollable, do you mean that he does not walk or interact with objects or is it that he is walking without you tapping on the screen to tell him to do so?

This is PAULA, Ray's wife...When it opens it goes to 2 then we tap Drawn Below....then we hit continue....it puts us back where we were...but has us out in the dark water which kills us immediately...or if it lets me move him at all and I get to the shore, I'm right in front of a door that opens and an octopus monster kills me immediately. Once after restarting and clearing out all tabs, it let me draw trees, which it never does and then do rain and grow them, but when I got to the top of the page and tried to go along behind the trees it killed me, as if I were not in the right place. When you try to draw trees, you can do your finger up at the top of the screen, but the green gets drawn somewhere else on the screen. I think things are displaced...like when it opens with him already in the dark water and getting killed. I hope you can fix this. The kids like it. Even this reply to you shows up in two places.
 
I am having Seane, a member of our customer service team create a ticket for you all in our ticketing system called Zendesk. So you should be receiving an e-mail shortly with the details from this post. I believe this will be a better way to keep in touch with you while we look into this issue.

P.S. I have removed your phone number from your reply as a matter of personal security on your part, but we will have it on file should we need to contact you. Thank you for being so eager to help us get it figured out!
 
Secondly, the red lines across the character aren't my scribbles, but weird lines I didn't input at all that connect the lines I did draw as added details (which turned red) in the order in which I drew them. O\_O
 
Hey @Stealthlock! I'm so sorry you ran into this issue! Thank you for elaborating with your device and OS version information. It seems like the game is capturing the vertices you're drawing incorrectly :(. When you color, do you do so for long stretches without letting up from the screen or do you do so in quick smaller swipes?
 
Sorry for the late reply/email request. I kept getting an error message when I tried to reply. Turns out my phone doesn't like sending longer messages on this forum. Oops. I'll break this message into pieces.
 
Thanks for helping me! I draw in pretty small strokes, but I draw a lot of them, and I undo frequently to get the strokes just right. The vertices didn't appear incorrect until I came back to check on them. Every time I went back to fix it, different vertices which were just fine suddenly have a different color or even pen size.
 
I spent a lot of time drawing a character in the drawing interface, but at some point it stopped letting me draw, like it had "run out of ink"--I'd draw one stroke of any kind and then it wouldn't let me draw any more. I pressed "undo" multiple times to try again, this time conserving ink. Pressing "undo" once erased multiple strokes, then continued back to erasing single strokes. Very strange.
 
I finished the drawing, adding eyes, mouth, fingers, toes, and wing details. These were drawn in black. I saved it and tested it out, only to find that all these details I'd added were changed to red (which I'd been drawing in before black) and looked sort of droopy. (I'd say it looked like blood, which was quite creepy, but also a coincidence and technically irrelevant.)
 
I posted the drawing online to see if I could fix it, but strange red lines appeared between all of the added details that had turned red, in the order I drew them. (Again, creepy, but also, irrelevant.)
 
I downloaded the picture to edit it. I used the "undo" function and all the details that had turned red were erased completely, in one "undo". (I uploaded this as well, in hopes of editing it, but it did that "out of ink" thing again)
 
In subsequent edit attempts, things have only gotten more strange. I keep coming back to edit only to find more ink strokes changed colors (to other colors I have used in the drawing) or even changed pencil sizes. The "undo" erases way more than it was supposed to when editor is first opened, then goes back to normal, and when I try to draw normally, it continues to suddenly behave as though it "ran out of ink" after an arbitrary number of strokes. (The "undo" glitch commonly occurs directly after the "ran out of ink" behavior.)
 
I tested a new stick man for this effect but it didn't happen, but I didn't spend nearly as much time (or strokes) on it, so I don't know if that's a factor. Any help is appreciated. If you'd like more screenshots I can get them. I hope you can see the two I sent. They should be where the asterisks are. If not, let me know and I'll try to send them a different way. Thanks so much!
 
And they responded back telling me to clear some space on my phone (it was pretty low on space) and uninstall and reinstall the app if that didn't work. I've now got 1 gig of space left but I'm not sure if that's enough to try again. (It had roughly 200 megabytes left before.)
 
Do you think this glitch is something that can be fixed, or is it all up to the user's remaining storage space? If the latter I totally understand. If I try to draw a second version of this character, I'd like to know he won't be broken partway through like the first time :\
 
**Draw a Stickman: EPIC 3** is the third installment in this saga that lets you design your own unique character to go on exhilarating adventures. The games give you the opportunity to use your own creativity to design your own hero who will overcome every obstacle and rival you come across in the different minigames.
 
After drawing your hero in Draw a Stickman: EPIC 3, you'll be ready to start exploring this animated universe. Specifically, your first step will be to talk to the main charter to find out what objectives you have to achieve in order to progress. The fact that you'll have to draw many of the elements you need to advance will keep you entertained as you constantly use your creativity.
 
To control your character, all you have to do is touch the screen to mark where you want it to move. Meanwhile, you'll use colored pencils to create waterfalls, barriers, and paths to continue on your way.
 
As you advance through each level in Draw a Stickman: EPIC 3 it'll get harder and harder to progress. However, you'll always be able to create new characters with different characteristics that will allow you to defeat any opponent. What's more, it's extremely important to be careful if you don't want your stickman to suffer irreversible damage.

***Draw a Stickman*** is an American adventure-puzzle video game franchise of games created and owned by game publishing company Hitcents, that depicts the adventures of a stickfigure hero in order to or rescue his friend from Zarp or defeat a group of corrupted purple-ink consumed enemies. Inspired by a concept originally created by Phil Williams, it has been active since its start in late 2011 with the first game and had made the company that published and developed it rise from obscurity.
 
*Draw a Stickman* was successful since its release for PC, Android and iOS devices. The series also had gotten several awards, nominations and recognition through other popular websites. It has also been the main subject of **this very Wiki**.
 
The concept used for the original game, was if Stick figures, the protagonists, were coming to life if you could draw them.[1] The idea for the series came out with one of Hitcents' employees who came up with the concept. The domain for Draw a Stickman was registered on March 16, 2010, and in this year, nothing is known about the game.[2][3]
 
The first release, *Draw a Stickman*, had its first independent level released on September 2011. The second level was only released on March 9, 2012 at the SXSW Conference and later on Browser. The first game was launched on an independent website named "drawastickman.com".
