It estimates that over 3 billion tons of minerals and metals will be needed to deploy wind, solar and geothermal power, as well as energy storage, required for achieving a below 2C future.
 
And while the growing demand for minerals and metals provides economic opportunities for resource-rich developing countries and private sector entities alike, significant challenges will likely emerge if the climate-driven clean energy transition is not managed responsibly and sustainably.

**The Climate-Smart Mining Initiative**will help resource-rich developing countries benefit from the increasing demand for minerals and metals, while ensuring the mining sector is managed in a way that minimizes the environmental and climate footprint.
 
The initiative supports the sustainable extraction and processing of minerals and metals to secure supply for clean energy technologies by minimizing the social, environmental, and climate footprint throughout the value chain of those materials by scaling up technical assistance and investments in resource-rich developing countries.
 
Without Climate-Smart Mining practices, negative impacts from mining activities will increase, affecting already-vulnerable communities in developing countries, as well as the environment in which they operate.

The Climate-Smart Mining approach has been developed in concert with the broader UN Sustainable Development Goals to ensure the decarbonization of the mining and energy sectors also benefits resource-rich countries that host these strategic minerals and the communities directly impacted by their extraction.
 
Climate-Smart Mining****builds on the work the World Bank is doing to help ensure resource-rich developing countries benefit from their mineral resources and manage them in a sustainable manner, while fostering economic growth and development. Our technical support also helps governments improve the investment climate by strengthening governance and building the capacities of key institutions, policy frameworks and legislation.
 
The World Bank wants to ensure that resource-rich developing countries also benefit from the new mineral demand by de-risking investments using sustainable and responsible resource development strategies.

**Indonesia, with a total population of 248,216,193 as of July 2012, is located in Southeastern Asia between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Indonesia covers a total area of 1,904,569 km2 and has a tropical climate. It is the largest archipelagic state and the third most populous democracy in the whole world.**
 
After several years of colonization, the country obtained independence in 1949 as a result of long-term political negotiations. However, the country is still struggling with unemployment, poverty, corruption, a complex regulatory environment, inadequate infrastructure, and unequal distribution of resources.
 
In 2010, Indonesia was a leading global supplier of tin and the country exported 85% of its tin production. In the same year, the production of tin decreased by 6.1% to about 43,000 t due to several reasons that include severe weather conditions that hit the mining operations in the country, illegal mining activities, and declining reserves.
 
Indonesia is planning to carry out more exploration activities and discover new mineral deposits in the coming years. Two new iron plants are expected to start up in 2012 in order to increase the steel production capacity within the next four years and thus reduce the import of steel. Indonesia also plans to increase its production and export of coal by developing new thermal coal projects and exploring new coal mines.

Mining natural resources are a collection of minerals, metals and minerals that are exploited for various human needs, such as industry, construction and energy. In Indonesia, mining natural resources have an important role in economic and industrial development.
 
Benefits: Apart from being used in jewelry, gold is also used in the electronics industry, such as making components for electronic devices, because of its corrosion resistance. Gold is also a safe investment and a source of income through exports.
 
Benefits: Aluminum is used in a variety of industries, including construction, automotive, and food packaging. Aluminum production also creates jobs and drives local economies in areas that have bauxite reserves.
 
Benefits: Non-metallic minerals such as phosphate are used in making agricultural fertilizers. Sulfur is used in the chemical, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Kaolin is used in the ceramic and paper industries. This mineral supports various industrial sectors.
 
Benefits: Industrial minerals such as salt, zeolite, and talc are used in various industries, including food, chemical, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. This mineral has a variety of applications and supports various products that we use every day.
 
Indonesia, with its incalculable natural treasures, lies as a country abundant with various mining resources, from the west to the east of the archipelago. The following is the potential and distribution of mining resources in Indonesia:
 
The vast potential and distribution of natural wealth in the form of mining is an eternal wealth for Indonesia. However, it needs to be wise in its management, so that the benefits are abundant in the long term for the country and society, without ignoring the potential environmental impacts that could occur.
 
Conservation of natural mining resources is a must in this modern era. These non-renewable natural resources must be managed sustainably so that they can be enjoyed by future generations. In Indonesia, efforts to conserve mining natural resources are increasingly receiving attention. Following are some of the efforts made:
 
The Indonesian government has tightened supervision and regulations related to mining. This includes mining permits being granted only to companies that meet strict environmental and safety standards. These regulations also include environmental impact assessments before starting mining operations.
 
After mining is complete, mining companies are required to carry out land reclamation. This means restoring excavated land so that it can be reused for other purposes, such as agriculture or reforestation. This step helps reduce the ecological impact of mining.
 
The mining industry is increasingly turning to green technology. This includes the use of more energy efficient equipment, better waste management and increased use of renewable energy in mining operations.
 
Increasing understanding of the importance of conserving natural mining resources is an important step. Environmental education and awareness programs are implemented to educate the public about the impacts of mining and the importance of preserving natural resources.
 
Mining companies often collaborate with NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and environmental organizations to develop conservation initiatives. They participate in environmental restoration programs and environmental impact monitoring.
 
Mining companies continue to seek technological innovation to reduce their impact on the environment. For example, they are looking for ways to reduce water and air pollution and optimize water use in mining operations.
 
Governments, mining companies and universities conduct research to identify technologies and best practices in the conservation of mining natural resources. The results of this research are used to improve practices in the field.
 
Mining natural resources in Indonesia have extraordinary potential and provide great benefits for this country. From gold to coal, Indonesia has emerged as a major player in the global mining industry. It is important for all of us to manage these resources wisely and sustainably to create a better future.
 
With the extraordinary potential of mining natural resources in Indonesia, it is important for us to understand their role and benefits. Hopefully this article provides useful insight into the wealth of natural mining resources in our homeland.
