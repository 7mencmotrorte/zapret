I write this while waiting for the names of the dead to be released. We do know that most of those who attended the concert were girls under the age of 18, who donned bunny ears and body glitter and recognized themselves in the lyrics of pop songs.

I thought about scrapping this draft completely. My self-centered ramblings about Facebook statues and pop punk seemed trivial only days after such horror. But as grief runs its course, the songs will stay stuck in your head. The bass will drop, and Ariana will perform again, swaying her ponytail from side to side. Keep listening, keep posting. And when a past self taps you on the shoulder, be kind to her.
 
This took a little digging, but not only is this a catchy part of the melody, it also emphasizes how sometimes we can find something in life so freeing and beautiful, yet have no words to describe it at the same time.

I like this line so much that I thought about painting a canvas of it or getting a sticker with it for my water bottle. These lyrics are so uplifting to me and I love thinking about how much the character loves this girl. I also love any play on words that incorporated the ordinary in extraordinary :)
 
Being able to sing about your emotions is one thing, but to express them in such an eloquent way is completely another. Billy executes this in such a powerful way, I love every lyric he selected for the song, but especially these. To paint the picture that we are drenched in the pain that shapes us into who we become is amazing. We can all immediately relate to this because we have all been there in one way or another.
 
With lyrics like "Don't want to be an American idiot, one nation controlled by the media," "American Idiot" became an anthem for political protests. In 2018, the song topped the music charts in the U.K. 14 years after its release ahead of former President Donald Trump's visit to England.
 
"Back then, if I look at a collage of one of those songs, it's become real life," Armstrong said and explained he wrote "American Idiot" about the Iraq War. "Without getting too political, it's important we look out for each other and show compassion."

American Idiot - Bit of a 'prequel' to the rest of the disk...basically, before Jesus is introduced, it talks about the bulk of today's youth being a bunch of conformists. The media owns the people, and these people are basically idiots. Jesus does not want to be one of these people...
 
Jesus of Suburbia - Intro to the main character, Jesus. The 'Son of Rage and Love'...basically, he grew up in a home where his father was hard on him and his mother loved him (reminds me of that 70's show), he basically turns to drugs and alcohol to stay sane in that home.
 
Holiday - I've heard some say that this song doesn't fit in with the story, when in fact it does. Jesus has left the protection of Mommy and Daddy...he now sees the real world, and what's goin on in the real world right now? THE WAR ON TERRORISM!!!! I also thing it has something to do with Arnold Schwarzenneger 'The representative from California has the floor'...but hey, what do i know?
 
Bvld. Broken Dreams - By far the best song on the album, Green Day probably would have released this first but who wants to release a power ballad for your first song in four years? Basically, it's really self-explanatory, Jesus is alone and confused...Hey, wouldn't you be to if you were alone?
 
We Are the Waiting - Not the best song on the album, but certainly the most anthemetic. This is Jesus's transformation from who he really is to who he needs to be to survive in the world - St. Jimmy. 'The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie'...he lies about his old life, he hates his old life...
 
She's a Rebel - Enter Whatshername, she's a rebel, she's a saint, she's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous! Well, Jesu--oops--St. Jimmy, meets her, begins to fall in love, sees her as a revolutionary, blah blah blah...but who does Whatsername want - Jesus or St. Jimmy?
 
Extraordinary Girl - lol trippy drums! Anywho, basically St. Jimmy is holding her up on a pedestal, as most guys do to the girl their in love with...and he would do anything to make her happy...but she's super sad
 
Letterbomb - Well, Whatsername and Jimmy are together...but not happy...Whatsername doesn't want Jimmy, she likes what he was, who he should be. This song actually has A LOT of depth. however, you can figure out this whole song and tie up any lose ends in the previous tracks. 'Your not the Jesus of Suburbia, and St. Jimmy is a figment of, your fathers rage and your mother's love, your now the idiot America...' and at the end when it says Whatsername is leaving. He's not Jesus anymore, he left who he was because he was scared. St. Jimmy is just an alter-ego made up by all Jesus had when he was growing up...his Fathers rage and his mothers love...and finally, think back to 'American Idiot'...what is Jesus...just an idiot...nobody likes him, everyones left him, there all out without him, having fun! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TRACK IN THE ALBUM'S STORYLINE!!!
 
Wake Me Up... - Love this song, no matter how heavy Green Day gets, every soft song they make is a knock-out...especially this one. Basically, what does Jimmy have left, Whatsername is gone...it's been seven years since he left, what does he have, where can he go. Obviously this takes place in September, and he's hoping that everything will be better by October...this song has a lot more death and it's even tied into rumours about Billie Joe's dad dying.
 
The Death of St. Jimmy - So what does sad, little, left with nothing St. Jimmy do? HE DIES!!! WELCOME BACK JESUS!!!! St. Jimmy is how Jesus spent most of his life, it was how he learnt how to live, love, and believe. Basically, the alter-ego St. Jimmy was the only thing he could turn to when Jesus was alone, dreamless, hopeless, so it's what he became.
 
IMPORTANT - Some might argue that St. Jimmy was infact not an alter-ego of what Jesus becomes, but infact was his sort of 'guide' out in the world, think about the last lines..."In the state, of mind, it's my own private suicide..."Basically, he just kills that state of mind, he is Jesus again.
 
Rock and Roll Girlfriend - I don't know when or where this fits in exactly, but I know it does cuz everything does. I'm tired of everyone saying this song sucks, it's not Green Day, blah blah blah...I personally like it...I think it sounds old school jazz rocky! but anyway, my guess is that it's one of Jesus's old friends, named TUNNY,...first of all it's addressed to St. Jimmy, which Jesus's friends probably still believe he goes by...and that by staying where he was and working he got the ultimate rock and roll life, while poor Jesus is all alone.
 
The majority of people in America follow the same ideology that is spewed from the mouths of politicians who are really just the voice of special interest groups and serve a specific agenda for their own benefit, and they get this information from biased media. People say that the media can't brainwash you but it most certainly can, after all our brain processes what our eyes see so all of the advertising and subliminal messages in media work when we are constantly processing this information in our brains. What we see and hear lingers in our brains and it can influence your thoughts.
 
The Bush Administration wanted the panic, tension, and fear implemented on the masses in order to throw away the constitution in the name of terrorism and "protecting" you when it did quite the opposite without people even realizing. It's funny how a country get's linked to a radical group, and get's invaded under false pretenses (weapons of mass destruction). Iraq has natural resources America wants (Oil) and Afghanistan has ninety percents of the worlds opium (most lucrative drug).
 
Then they try to make you out to be unpatriotic if you question your government, well honestly to you Americans who question the motives of war I would say that is one of the most patriotic things you could do. People of your Country are dying in a senseless war, your economy is getting crushed because of ridiculous spending (120 million a month on war). America needs to quit being the world police , and start worrying about their own.
 
As for all of the comments on this page, leave the arguing for political and debate forums this is SONG MEANINGS. express your thoughts and feeling about the song and move on, people don't want to sift through your 100 replies in a flame war, when trying to find out different meanings to a song they like. And if you don;t like the band, why would you specifically search them out and comment on one of their Song meaning pages? obviously you liked something about the song and if you don;t and specifically came to flame people who DO like the song you must be a sad individual and I feel sorry for you. Seriously, you're scouting out somewhere to be deconstructive?
 
People have DIFFERENT opinions about the song and it's message, if we didn't we would be robots. Embrace individuality, but express you different opinions and carry on so we don;t have to sift through a bunch of generic, useless information about the song.
