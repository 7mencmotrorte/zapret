Drafts uses templates to control how text is output in action steps. Templates allow for configurable values in actions to be dynamically constructed from text in your draft, insert timestamps, and other information, without needing to alter the text in your draft.
 
To contribute to the stability and effectiveness of the European financial system, the EBA develops harmonised rules for financial institutions, promotes convergence of supervisory practices, monitors, and advises on the impact of financial innovation and the transition to sustainable finance.

To ensure the orderly functioning and stability of the financial system in the European Union, we monitor and analyse risks and vulnerabilities relevant for the regulation of banks and investment firms. We also facilitate information sharing among authorities and institutions through supervisory reporting and data disclosure.
 
Communicating to all our audiences in the most effective way and using the most appropriate channels is crucial for us. Through our publications, announcements, and participation in external events, we are committed to reaching out to all our stakeholders to report about our policies, activities, and initiatives.
 
**The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on draft templates for collecting climate related data from EU banks. This effort is part of the one-off Fit-for-55 climate risk scenario analysis, which the EBA will carry out together with the other European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and with the support of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The draft templates are accompanied by a template guidance, which includes definitions and rules for compiling the templates. The consultation runs until 11 October 2023.**
 
The draft templates are designed to collect climate-related and financial information on credit risk, market and real estate risks. Banks are asked to report aggregated and counterparty level data as of December 2022. Collecting counterparty level data will allow to assess concentration risk of large climate exposures, as well as to capture amplification mechanisms and assess second round effects. Aggregated data will inform on the climate-related risks of the banking sector more broadly.

Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 11 October 2023.
 
70 banks will take part in this exercise (same banks as those included in the 2023 EU-wide stress test). In addition, Competent authorities might request other banks in their respective jurisdictions to participate.
 
As a first step, the exercise requires each ESA, with the support of the ECB, if needed, to produce sector-specific results, based on three ad-hoc climate scenarios (i.e., one baseline and two adverse scenarios) implemented by the ESRB. These results will then be used by the ECB to produce cross-sectoral results and to model second round effects.
 
Our mission is to contribute to the stability and effectiveness of the European financial system through simple, consistent, transparent, fair regulation and supervision that benefits all EU citizens.
 
These template drafts can be in the archive or inbox, but I recommend moving them to the archive to avoid cluttering your inbox. Templates can also be flagged. When the action is run, the prompt to select a template sorts based on the text of the draft but also sorts flagged templates to the top of the select list, so if you flag often-used templates, they will appear first.
 
Template drafts can also contain drafts tags. Tags will be evaluated when new drafts are created using the template, so are great for inserting dynamic time stamps. If you are new to using tags in Drafts, this is a great guide.
 
Often, you may have one or more values you want to fill in in a template after creating it. This action, along with the two companion actions below, make it easy to do that by creating fill-in placeholders in the template in the format (fieldname is optional, will work also, but the field name allows you to notate what to fill-in).
 
If you have templates with more than one placeholder, install the sample actions below to get an easy way to navigate through placeholder in a draft to insert new values. When used, they will move the text selection to the next (or previous) placeholder, ready for you to type the replacement text.
 
After creating a new draft, the draft would be open in the editor with as the selected text, ready for you to replace that value. You could then use the next/previous placeholder actions to move the selection to each value to complete the new draft.
 
Sometimes you realize you want to use a template after you have started on a draft. We also provide an example Apply Template action, which can be used to apply the tags, syntax, and content from one of your templates to the current draft.
 
It works quite similarly to the previous use of the date template tag, but it uses the JavaScript below to lookup the timezone offset identifier and then inserts the defined date/time string to the current selection and after that, jumps the cursor to the end of the newly inserted text.
 
Given your statement above re. programming, it may simply be that, for now, using that first format is the way to go and with more experience you might come up with a good way for you to include in the original action; but in the interim you can always have the action I posted available to manually insert it if required.
 
One thing I would like is the ability to prompt the user for non-standard template items. So the code would use a service (probably a new one) to scan the selected template and use it to pop up prompts the user would fill in.
 
Is there somewhere I can access templates that have not yet been published? I spent quite a while creating a new template and navigated back to the Activity Feed accidentally. I hadn't yet published the template, and now can't find it anywhere.
 
As a workaround to avoid losing form data in the future, I use an add-on called Typio Form recovery which saves (nearly) everything I type into a form in my browser. I can recover it later whenever I inadvertently navigate away from a page. There are a few other add-ons that do the same thing. I would recommend having a look at this list: 3 Browser Extensions to Save What You Type into Online Forms and Text Boxes
 
Use email templates to send messages that include information that infrequently changes from message to message. Compose and save a message as a template, and then reuse it when you want it. New information can be added before the template is sent as an email message.
 
IEEE article templates let you quickly format your article and prepare a draft for peer review. Templates help with the placement of specific elements, such as the author list. They also provide guidance on stylistic elements such as abbreviations and acronyms.
 
All resources are periodically reviewed and updated by the Subawards Subcommittee with the effort and support of its various working groups, with input from the membership. Revised versions are posted to this page as needed.
