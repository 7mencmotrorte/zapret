**Note:** The package architecture has to match the Linux kernel architecture, that is, if you are running a 64-bit kernel, install the appropriate AMD64 package (it does not matter if you have an Intel or an AMD CPU). Mixed installations (e.g. Debian/Lenny ships an AMD64 kernel with 32-bit packages) are not supported. To install VirtualBox anyway you need to setup a 64-bit chroot environment.
 
We provide a yum/dnf-style repository for Oracle Linux/Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE. All .rpm packages are signed. The Oracle public key for rpm can be downloaded here. You can add this key (not normally necessary, see below!) with

Note that importing the key is not necessary for yum users (Oracle Linux/Fedora/RHEL/CentOS) when using one of the virtualbox.repo files from below as yum downloads and imports the public key automatically! Zypper users should run
 
With new version you need to use VMSVGA driver, unfortunately NixOS needs a fix to work with it, and here it is: nixos/virtualbox-guest: support VMSVGA graphics adapter by bachp Pull Request #86473 NixOS/nixpkgs GitHub but it is hanging there, I guess it needs attention from someone who can merge it.
 
The second one is creating a service that would run VBoxClient --vmsvga this will enable screen resizing. Note though that the patch that is waiting (nixos/virtualbox-guest: support VMSVGA graphics adapter by bachp Pull Request #86473 NixOS/nixpkgs GitHub) is using xrandr to change screen size, once it is merged those two might conflict with each other and you should remove this from your config.
 
I like this method, because it seems to work better on my machine, it also resizes the login screen. It looks like it needs to run as root though (maybe there is a way to make it run as unprivileged user). From what I read other OSes also run this as a service so perhaps this is correct approach.
 
I was able to make this work by making vboxclient systemd service to run in user namespace and depending (via WantedBy) on graphical-session.target. Here is the configuration which worked for me (with also a service for clipboard sharing):

While common, widely used & supported USB devices such as mouse and keyboard HIDs connected to the host machine have been working well within the VBox guest (otherwise it would be plenty useless ), more "niche" USB devices such as FTDI, ST-Link or Keil debuggers for STM32, were extremely unreliable or didn't work at all, and our whole team back then couldn't resolve the issues and we gave up on that.
 
Now, I don't know whether there's anything inherent in the whole setup that makes this problem eternal, or it was just the state of development of VBox and/or the involved operating systems and drivers of back then.
 
I actually am thinking about using Linux as a host in my new laptop (that is to be carried around only in special situations, not regularly), and putting Windows in a VM for certain use cases. But Linux-on-Linux is also an imaginable scenario. More on that below.
 
Has this improved? Is STM32 development from within a VM, including debugging the hardware connected to the host computer (ST-link with reliable instruction stepping, variable reads, as well as virtual com port text), feasible now?
 
I could have the VirtualMachine, with all the work-related stuff installed, on an external drive, and carry that between work-from-home vs. work-in-office days, plug it in, and just run the VM and everything is fine. While, when at home not working, the rest of the laptop is untouched by work stuff, and vice versa.
 
If you search the net for search terms like "st-link virtualbox", you will find a lot of similar questions, but also messages that it works without problems or hints that you have to share USB ports (by default = dsbl) or activate the USB EHCI controller in the VM, etc- All in all, it doesn't seem to be a problem with the ST-Link or its drivers, but with Virtualbox and its settings.
 
However, I have not yet tested this myself in the- Virtualbox, because I can easily take a project that works with relative paths as an archive and debug it on another computer, so that a VM does not bring any significant advantage.
 
As far as I know virtualbox will not work trying to run guests using wayland.I tried to install the beta awhile back in virtualbox and it would not work.It did install and work well using gnome boxes.I have Arch and EndeavourOS KDE running as guests in virtualbox and they still have the option to use xorg so they both work well.Neither will boot trying to use wayland.

With that said, this worked fine for myself. I was not able to replicate your issue with a standard installation of Rocky Linux. In my case, I used the XFCE desktop. GNOME (Workstation) and others should work the same way.
 
So, the short version of this long story is that GA seems to have installed, at least partially, but with some problems. There still are errors during compiles for the GA installation yet some of it works.
 
If you are continuing to have issues, I would suggest uninstalling all the drivers, rebooting, and trying to install them again. You could also start clean and just reinstall Rocky Linux 9 entirely to the VM and run through the installation steps for the guest additions.
 
Not sure if needed when running the USB port in pass-through mode to a VM in VirtualBox under Windows 10 but normally when wanting to access the adapter direct under Windows 10 you would need to install drivers:
 
It is an option for you though - you run your PC as the media server, and also run VirtualBox already. So your could easily run HAOS as your VM guest, directly under your VirtualBox. This is what Hedda meant to convey.
 
In the future, the method that always works for me is to add the USB stick in virtualbox. Then remove the stick and shut down the virtual machine. While it is off, plug the stick back in. Then start the VM.
 
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or virtualizer, is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Unlike an emulator, the guest executes mo...
 
No information at all on the internet how to boot Voss in virtualbox? I am almost sure that I found a topic about this on a site, can't remember which one though. You can check this source about .vmdk, the steps are almost the same, it can help you to boot the Voss. I didn't try it before, but according to people from the commentary section it worked perfectly, so it can work for you as well. The process is described in details, so you should have no problems with it, everything is very clear.
 
Unfortunately, my attempts to boot Voss in Virtualbox fails. This is with VOSS 8.2 configured with 64 bit Linux as OS and 2048 Mb RAM. Same result with converting image from qcow2 to vmdk and importing qcow2 directly to Virtualbox.
 
VirtualBox is a hypervisor used to run operating systems in a special environment, called a virtual machine, on top of the existing operating system. VirtualBox is in constant development and new features are implemented continuously. It comes with a Qt GUI interface, as well as headless and SDL command-line tools for managing and running virtual machines.
 
In order to integrate functions of the host system to the guests, including shared folders and clipboard, video acceleration and a seamless window integration mode, guest additions are provided for some guest operating systems.
 
To compile the VirtualBox modules provided by virtualbox-host-dkms, it will also be necessary to install the appropriate headers package(s) for your installed kernel(s) (e.g. linux-lts-headers for linux-lts). [1] When either VirtualBox or the kernel is updated, the kernel modules will be automatically recompiled thanks to the DKMS pacman hook.
 
virtualbox-host-modules-arch and virtualbox-host-dkms use systemd-modules-load.service to load VirtualBox modules automatically at boot time. For the modules to be loaded after installation, either reboot or load the modules once manually; the list of modules can be found in /usr/lib/modules-load.d/virtualbox-host-modules-arch.conf or /usr/lib/modules-load.d/virtualbox-host-dkms.conf.
 
It is also recommended to install the virtualbox-guest-iso package on the host running VirtualBox. This package will act as a disc image that can be used to install the guest additions onto guest systems other than Arch Linux. The *.iso* file will be located at /usr/lib/virtualbox/additions/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso, and may have to be mounted manually inside the virtual machine. Once mounted, you can run the guest additions installer inside the guest. For Arch Linux guest also see VirtualBox/Install Arch Linux as a guest#Install the Guest Additions.
 
In order to avoid having to install the guest system manually, some operating systems support *unattended installation*. This allows the user to configure the system to be installed in VirtualBox's interface prior to starting the machine. At the end of the setup process, the operating system is installed without requiring any further user interaction. This feature requires the virtualbox-unattended-templatesAUR package.
