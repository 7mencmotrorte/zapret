The Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL) provides strategic funding to answer these challenges, supporting projects in key capacity areas such as: supercomputing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, advanced digital skills, and ensuring a wide use of digital technologies across the economy and society. It supports industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and public administration in their digital transformation with a reinforced network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH).

Digital describes electronic technology that generates, stores and processes data in terms of positive and nonpositive states. Positive is expressed or represented by the number 1 and nonpositive by the number 0. Thus, data transmitted or stored with digital technology is expressed as a string of 0s and 1s. Each of these state digits is referred to as a bit; a string of bits that a computer can address individually as a group is a byte.
 
Before the digital age, electronic transmission was limited to analog technology, which conveys data as electronic signals of varying frequency or amplitude added to carrier waves of a given frequency. Broadcast and phone transmission have conventionally used analog technology.
 
The word *digital* can also, more broadly, apply to anything that's represented or processed by means of digital technology, such as virtual reality, audiobooks, digital music, mobile apps, digital art, digital communication, digital media, podcasts and digital marketing.
 
Digital technology is primarily used with new physical communications media, such as satellite and fiber optic transmission. A modem is used to convert the digital information in computers to analog signals for phone lines and to convert analog phone signals to digital information for computers.
 
Communication through digital technology can also include a wide range of communication channels such as email, text messaging, social media marketing, video conferencing, instant messaging, e-commerce and collaboration tools.

The Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) is a renewed European Union (EU) policy initiative that sets out a common vision of high-quality, inclusive and accessible digital education in Europe, and aims to support the adaptation of the education and training systems of Member States to the digital age.
 
The Action Plan, adopted on 30 September 2020, is a call for greater cooperation at European level on digital education to address the challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to present opportunities for the education and training community (teachers, students), policy makers, academia and researchers on national, EU and international level.
 
Digital transformation has changed society and the economy with an ever deepening impact on everyday life, and demonstrated the need for higher levels of digital capacity of education and training systems and institutions.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the existing trend towards online and hybrid learning. It uncovered new and innovative ways for students and educators to organise their teaching and learning activities and to interact in a more personal and flexible manner online. In parallel, the uptake of digital technologies for education revealed challenges and inequalities between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not (including individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds); and challenges related to the digital capacities of education and training institutions, teacher training and overall levels of digital skills and competences.
 
These changes called for a strong and coordinated effort at the EU level to support education and training systems to address the challenges identified and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, while putting forward a long-term vision for the way ahead for European digital education.
 
The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies. The DMA complements, but does not change EU competition rules, which continue to apply fully.
 
DMA Annual Report 2023 - Article 35 DMA requires the Commission to submit an annual report on the implementation of the DMA and the progress made towards achieving its objectives. This is the first report of this kind, covering the first year in which the DMA became applicable.
 
The European Commission is the sole enforcer of the DMA. A joint team in the Directorates-General for Competition (DG COMP) and Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the DMA.
 
**The rapid development and adoption of digital technology is transforming how people worldwide access information, goods, and services. Digital technology has the power to spur economic growth, improve development outcomes, and lift millions out of poverty.**
 
While digital tools hold immense potential to help people live more free and prosperous lives, they also present significant risks to citizen privacy and data, freedom of the press, and individual expression. Authoritarian governments and malign actors may wield digital tools to suppress political dissent and exploit system vulnerabilities or individuals who lack digital literacy.
 
By making rules more digital-friendly and safe for consumers, the Commission aims to leverage synergies between high innovative start-ups and established firms in the financial sector while addressing associated risks.
 
The digital finance strategy sets out general lines on how Europe can support the digital transformation of finance in the coming years, while regulating its risks. The strategy sets out four main priorities: removing fragmentation in the Digital Single Market, adapting the EU regulatory framework to facilitate digital innovation, promoting a data-driven finance and addressing the challenges and risks with digital transformation, including enhancing the digital operational resilience of the financial system.
 
Embracing digital finance would unleash European innovation and create opportunities to develop better financial products for consumers, including for people currently unable to access financial services. It unlocks new ways of channelling funding to EU businesses, in particular SMEs.
 
The Commission proposes a framework on crypto-assets to allow for innov
