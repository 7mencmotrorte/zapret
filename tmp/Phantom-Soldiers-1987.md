I was browsing around blogs a few weeks ago and tripped over a new one (for me anyway), Jack J's fantastic site When the Vietnam War Raged... in the Philippines. This guy watches and reviews nothing but vietnam war movies that were filmed in the Philippines, of which there are many. In one of his many posts he pointed readers to an eBay seller that was auctioning off some rare Japanese VHS tapes of some of his favourite movies. After reading all I could on Jack's blog I decided to take a punt and won the videos. I've always had a soft spot for VHS and had known for a while that Japan had some of the rarest movies released there and often released them in their original aspect ratio - a rare thing for the time. The first of the videos I got was this one, Phantom Soldiers. So, was it worth the effort?
 
In a word, yes. This movie was fantastic and simply makes me eager to see more like it. I don't think I've seen this many explosions in the one movie since... well, ever I think. It's quite insane! We start in "Vietnam" (obviously, the Philippines) where a team of solders in all black gear and black gas masks begin laying waste to a small village. Not content with machine-gunning the villagers, the soldiers blow up their homes - every last one of them - and then heard the survivors to the beach and gas them. Pretty full on!

Cut to the Mexican/Texas border where the movies' hero Daniel Custer (Max Thayer, star of B-classic such as Martial Law II, No Retreat No Surrender 2, Sworn to Justice) and his team of undercover law enforcers are about to infiltrate a Mexican drug-running operation and catch the leader Castro. Custer feigns injury to confuse the guards while his compadres sneak around the back, but they are spotted and a shootout takes place though is quickly put to rest when Custer's team take out most of the enemy with missile launchers. So many explosions. I'm in heaven.
 
American soldiers arrive on the scene in Vietnam to survey the damage caused by the phantoms and find a painted skull on a pike. The prop is so obviously made of plastic. The Captain is informed and smashes his fists on the table in annoyance. I've seen some bad acting and awful ADR in my time but this guy takes the cake. His portrayal is so downright hilarious I burst out in laughter whenever he's on the screen. The soldier shows the Captain the painted skull and the Captain simply says: "Ah. Just like The Phantom. Well, this is another for my collection" and puts the skull on a shelf behind his desk with five others! Bahaha!
 
More army guys arrive in Vietnam and search for those responsible for destroying the village. One soldier sees a masked man in the bushes and fires wildly at him, and in a scene lifted right out of Predator the rest of his platoon fire wildly as well. Following the trail they watch from a clearing as more phantom soldiers are slaughtering farmers, and although they've been strictly informed they are on reconnaissance only, the team leader - who I should mention at this point is Daniel Custer's brother, Michael - go in to assist. Chasing the phantom soldiers into another forest they run into a guy (in all black...) that says the phantoms are on a secret mission for the CIA. This of course is a lie and the American soldiers are trapped in gunfire with only three survivors (Michael being one of them).
 
So much violence and we haven't even made it to the main plot point yet. Daniel Custer, returned from his jaunt in Mexico, gets a visit from an army guy who tells him his brother is missing in action in Vietnam. Daniel, a former soldier himself, goes to see his old Captain for permission to go to Vietnam and find Michael. He gets denied but the very next scene he is wearing someone else's uniform and cowboy hat and stealing a plane ride to Vietnam. Arriving at the American base he is immediately, and randomly, thrown into the chaos of war as hundreds of Vietnamese attack. This is a superb piece of war action that does not let up; machine guns, mortars, missiles, you name it. I'm not sure if the attack was a response to the phantom soldiers attack on the village or just the war in general, it's not explained. America wins in the end and Custer interrogates a POW who tells him about the phantom soldiers.
 
This is such a great flick, perfect war action fodder and a definite repeat viewer. The acting is generally bad, though the star Max Thayer is pretty good (and a really nice guy too; check out this interview I found). There is a hilarious fat Russian chef later who you have to see to believe when he insists on death by firing squad for swearing. They even manage to get a titty bar with bar fight into the movie, and the final shootout is just awesome with Custer firing a missile launcher at close range at a guy who literally says "Eep!" before being gibbed.
 
If the other Philo' war movies I got are anything like Phantom Soldiers I will be extremely happy. The director, Teddy Page, has a solid B-movie biography with at least five movies starting with the word "Blood". Happily I also picked up another of his Philo' war movies on Japanese VHS, Blood Debts, so expect a review of that in the near future.
 
As I mentioned above, this is a Japanese VHS. It looks great and is in widescreen with mono English audio and burnt in Japanese subtitles (you forget they are there after a while). As far as I'm aware this is the best way to see this movie. I thought I could clean the video up a little so have spent some time encoding it and running it through some filters to correct the colour a little, fix the VHS chroma ghosting, stretch it out to 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and apply a light sharpen filter. Call it a hobby I guess. I'm pretty happy with the end result and the screenshots above are from my new DVD edition.

Texas Ranger Daniel Custer leaves for Vietnam to find his brother Michael, a Green Beret Lieutenant who has been reported missing in action. Michael's squad was searching for a mysterious group of 'phantom soldiers' that had been using US-made arms for massacring villages and killing unarmed civilians. Daniel goes out on his own into the jungles of Vietnam to find his brother and stop these killers.
 
Sometimes you want to watch a movie with really exquisitely choreographed action scenes that shock and surprise you, and sometimes you want to watch a movie that is 90% straw huts exploding, people jumping away from grenade explosions, dudes flipping themselves over sandbags, and guys shooting machine guns at each other over and over and over.
 
Philipino Vietnam actioneer starts strong with a squad of soldiers dressed in gasmasks and black clothing that massacre an entire jungle village in a quite violent sequence. It can't really top that as we settle into the usual routine with a Texas ranger looking for his missing brother in nam but keeps things rolling with a regular serving of the usual violent action scenes. The acting is horrendous but it's fun to spot a barrage of familiar faces from various exploitation flicks lensed in the Philippines.
 
As I watched more and more of Phantom Soldiers I kept thinking about that Steven Soderbergh line where he was talking about how he didn't understand how a bunch of people didn't die during the making of Mad Max: Fury Road.
 
I don't understand how a bunch of people didn't die during the making of Phantom Soldiers. It's not so much the stunts, more the explosions. This must have had a decent chunk of money thrown at it because they just blow up fucking EVERYTHING in this. And those explosions often look no more than a few feet from where some of these dudes are standing. Absolutely the most irresponsible shit you can imagine.
 
Certainly not good in terms of its acting or dubbed dialogue, but about half of the Philippines jungle gets blown to fiery bits in this crazily excessive war actioner. If you are considering trying one of these cheap Filipino genre pictures, it's pretty much all down hill after PHANTOM SOLDIERS.
 
Hey, I'm NOT gonna comment on every post you write, haha. BUT this is one of my favourites. Maybe it's not hugely better than the rest of them but I like the fact that it's almost a Vietnam war HORROR movie with those creepy phantom soldiers. I have this on Japanes vhs. There's a trailer here:

Then a bunch of workers in blue outfits are seen working under the supervision of soldiers as they grunt a lot, and I do mean *a lot*. I almost expected a gay orgy to be happening off-screen, but instead we just see workers carrying things around and subtly making faces.
 
When he puts the basket down and walks off-screen, the movie feels the need to let us know how guarded this place is with a few interestingly long shots of soldiers walking around in different places.
 
After a moment the guy keeps running and the soldiers continue chasing, and literally 5 seconds after running he succeeds at hiding again right under their noses in some brush. Once the soldiers run by without even bothering to check that area, the man peaks up and gives us his best Rambo face.
 
The soldiers regroup, reporting failure to find shit, and then split up to look some more. Immediately after that little scene, we see that M15 was captured and brought back to the U.S. Army Munitions Dump, based on the practically unreadable hand-painted sign on the fence. I guess the Army was really on a tight budget in 1987.
