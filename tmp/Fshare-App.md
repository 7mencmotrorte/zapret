For account related tasks, JDownloader is using the official fshare.vn API.
The API can only be used with a given set of **app key** and a special **User-Agent** string and only works with premium accounts thus JD only supports fshare.vn premium accounts.

Action:Correct the problem indicated by the other message(s). If possible, change options to reduce required memory and/or take steps to increase memory available to the process. Otherwise, report this error to Oracle Support Services.
 
Action:Ensure that a file system check is not being run on another node or by another user before retrying the command. If a file system check operation had been started and then aborted, use 'fsck -f' to repair the volume and then retry the command.
 
Action:Verify that ACFS helper commands are installed in the '/sbin/helpers/acfs' directory and that '/etc/vfs' contains the correct information for ACFS. If the solution is not clear, contact Oracle Support Services.
 
Cause:An error was returned by the Oracle Registry service when attempting to create an ACFS key. This message is accompanied by other message(s) that provide details as to the exact cause of the failure.
 
Action:Run ocrcheck to verify the Oracle Registry is working properly. Evaluate the error message returned from the Oracle Registry appended to this message. If necessary, run ocrdump and make sure the "SYSTEM" key exists and is accessible.
 
Action:Another error message number will follow this message. Analyze its output. Run ocrcheck to verify the Oracle registry is functioning properly. Also, verify acfsutil was invoked with administrative rights when attempting to add the ACFS mount points.
 
Cause:The file system was created on a computer which has a different Endian than the current system. Little Endian machines (such as the intel x86 based systems) store the Least Significant bit in the first byte of an integer value. Big Endian machines (such as Solaris SPARC and AIX Power based systems) store the Most Significant bit in the first byte of an integer value.
 
Cause:An ACFS file system could not be created because an error occurred during the generation of a file system identifier. This message is accompanied by other messages providing details on the error.
 
Cause:The file system creation failed because the specified volume was not an ADVM volume. The default set of options requires an ADVM volume. If the specified volume is a local volume, the -l option is required.
 
Cause:An attempt to create a file system was rejected because the logical sector sizes of primary and accelerator volume were different, as shown. The sector sizes of the primary and accelerator volumes must be the same.
 
Cause:An attempt to create a file system failed because the ADVM disk group compatibility had not been upgraded to the indicated version for either the primary or accelerator volume, which is required for that command.
 
Action:Use the Oracle ASM Configuration Assistant (ASMCA) tool or the SQL ALTER DISKGROUP statement to upgrade the disk group compatibility (COMPATIBLE.ADVM attribute) to the specified version and then re-issue the original command. If the disk group compatibility cannot be upgraded, update the ACFS compatibility using the 'acfsutil compat set' command and then re-issue the original command.
 
Action:Select devices with a 512-byte logical sector size when creating a file system using the 'i 512' format switch. Use the command 'advmutil volstats' to verify that the volume's sector size is 512 bytes before formatting the file system. Alternatively, format the file system without the 'i 512' switch, allowing Oracle ACFS to create a 4096-byte metadata block size format.
 
Action:Allow the ACFS checker to complete before retrying the mount. If the ACFS checker is not running on this file system and a file system check was previously interrupted, reissue the ACFS checker.
 
Cause:An ACFS file sytem could not be mounted because it was created on a computer which has a different endianness than the current system. Little endianness machines (such as the Intel X86 based systems) store the Least Significant Bit in the first byte of an integer value. Big endianness machines (such as Solaris SPARC and AIX Power based systems) store the Most Significant Bit in the first byte of an integer value.
 
Cause:While creating an administrative network share for the specified ACFS mount point, failed to retrieve information on any network share that might already exist at the required share name. This message is accompanied by other messages providing details on the error.
 
Cause:The file system's internal storage bitmap has a five extent limit. Growing the file system may fail if it has already been grown four or more times, using up all available storage bitmap extents.
 
Cause:The acfsutil snap command failed because the indicated name was not a valid snapshot name. Possible reasons include: 1) The snapshot name exceeded the limit of 255 characters. 2) The snapshot name equaled "." or "..". 3) The snapshot name contained "/" (Unix or Linux). 4) The snapshot name contained "" or ":" (Windows). 5) The snapshot name contained an illegal character for NTFS file names (Windows).
 
Action:Examine the accompanying messages, resolve the indicated problems, and then retry the operation. If another registration is using this device or mountpoint, remove the existing registration before retrying the operation.
 
Action:Run ocrcheck to verify the Oracle Registry service is working properly. If the ACFS mount entry is in an inconsistent state delete it, then re-add it using acfsutil with the registry option. If the problem persists, contact Oracle Support Services.
 
Cause:An attempt to resize an ADVM volume failed because ASM did not have enough contiguous free diskgroup storage. This could have been a transient condition if ASM rebalance was running, otherwise the ASM alert logs may provide detailed failure indications.
 
Action:Check the ASM alert logs, address ASM issues if any, and retry the resize. If ASM rebalance is running it may release sufficient space by completion to allow a retry of the resize to succeed. Monitor V$ASM\_DISK.FREE\_MB view, if desired, to track free storage and retry the resize if sufficient storage becomes available. Otherwise, retry the resize after using ASM commands to increase the free space or retry, specifying a smaller quantity.
 
Action:Try again later. The system console log will contain mirror recovery started and completed messages. For example: [Oracle ADVM] Mirror recovery for volume asm/volume-name started. [Oracle ADVM] Mirror recovery for volume asm/volume-name completed.
