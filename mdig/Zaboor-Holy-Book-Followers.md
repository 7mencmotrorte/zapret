It is common knowledge that Muslims recognize **four** remaining holy books out of atotal of 104 revelations, of which 100 are missing. Although Muslims are often taught thatthe 3 remaining books previous to the Koran have been altered, still, Muslims for the mostpart, respect those 3 holy books. The 3 holy books are known as the *Tawrat, Zabur,*and*Injil.*

This paper will not deal with the Muslim belief in abrogation of previous scriptures,nor will it major on the Muslim belief in the corruption of the scriptures by Jews andChristians. The purpose of this paper is to examine the various opinions held regardingthese 3 holy books. How did they come up with that understanding?
 
Let it be stated here that this author has confidence that the Tawrat, Zabur and Injilextant today amongst Jews and Christians (i.e. the Holy Bible), are the same as thosebooks originally given by almighty Allah.
 
Muslim belief about the previous holy books has been in part shaped by the ProphetMuhammad (pbuh)'s interaction with Jews and Christians of his time. Some of these Jews andChristians were his earlier converts. The prophet's first wife, Khadijah was known as aChristian before converting to Islam, as was her cousin Waraka (or Warqa), who wasconsidered a serious Bible student and perhaps even a translator of Scripture. So it wouldbe beneficial to try to understand exactly what the Koran says about those holy books, andalso what Jews and Christians of that time would have thought about the books. In doingthis, we will also look at the holy Injil's use of various titles for differentScriptures.
 
*The religious dissociation of Abraham and other religious personalities from themain body of Jews and Christians was an inevitable consequence of two strands among Jewsand Christians. The Qur'an continuously praises the one strand, and condemns the other,e.g., 'From among them (i.e., the People of the Book) there is an upright group but mostof them perpetrate misdeeds' (V, 66). They were asked to live up to the **Torah** andthe **Evangel** (V, 68), but, like the proprietors of all organized religioustraditions, Jews and Christians quarrelled among themselves and each claimed that the keysof salvation were firmly in their exclusive grasp: 'The Jews say the Christians havenothing to stand on and the Christians say the Jews have nothing to stand on, and theyboth read the Book' (II, 120).* (Fazlur Rahman, Islam, pg. 27)
 
It may be inferred from the preceding quote from Fazlur Rahman that the Scriptures ofthe Jews and Christians may be summed up in the words *Torah (or Tawrat)*and *Evangel(or Injil)*, i.e. the Old Testament and the New Testament. This thinking is partly dueto the Koran's own testimony, more of which will be seen later. The same belief isexpressed by A.J. Arberry, noted English Muslim in his introduction to his translation ofthe Koran:

*It was We who revealed the **Law** (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. Byits standard have been judged the Jews, by the Prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to God'sWill, by the Rabbis and the Doctors of Law: For to them was entrusted the protection ofGod's Book, and they were witnesses thereto: Therefore fear not men, but fear Me, and sellnot my Signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Godhath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers. We ordained therein for them:"Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and woundsequal for equal."....* (surah 5:47,48a)
 
*Abu Harairah said: When the Prophet (may peace be upon him) went to his bed, he usedto say: O God! Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth, Lord of everything, Who splittestthe grain and the kernel, Who hast sent down the Torah, the Injil and the Qur'an, I seekrefuge in Thee from the evil of every evil agent whose forelock thou seizest...*(SunanAbu Dawud, vol. 3, pg. 1403.)
 
Of course, the prophet knew that the*Zabur* had also been sent down, but perhapsin his thinking he was including it under the *Tawrat*, i.e. the Jewish Scriptures.Another tradition makes an apparent quote from the *Tawrat*, a prophecy regarding theProphet:
 
*Ka'b, quoting the Torah, said we find written, "Muhammad God's messenger, **Mychosen servant, is not rough, or coarse, or loud-voiced in the streets, he does notrequite evil with evil, but forgives and pardons.**His birthplace will be in Mecca, hisplace of emigration in Taiba, his kingdom in Syria, and his people will be those who aredevoted to praising, who praise God in prosperity and adversity, who praise God in every*
 
*alighting-place, who declare God's greatness on every rising ground, who watch forthe sun and observe the prayer when its time comes, who tie their lower garments roundtheir middle, who perform ablution at their extremities, who crier summons in the openair, who are the same in fighting as they are in prayer, who make a low sound at nightlike the buzzing of bees."*(Mishkat Al-Masabih, vol. 2, pg. 1237.)
 
*Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put mySpirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out, orraise his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick hewill not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; he will not falter or bediscouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put theirhope.*
 
The last reference is of interest because of the quotation from Psalm 37:29 which says,*"the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever."* Many Muslimsscholars think that it also has reference to Exodus 32:13, *"...it will be theirinheritance forever."*
 
The verse states that the Prophet's Companions were a mixture of humililty andstrength. Strong against enemies of God, humble toward God and other believers. It saysthat their humble prostration in prayer is like that found in the *Tawrat* (cp.Numbers 16:22, "Moses and Aaron fell facedown..."). Then it says that thestrength and victory of Muslims is like that spoken of in the *Gospel*, apparentlyreferring to the parables of Isa:
 
*...A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up,the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil producesgrain -- first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head... ...like amustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground. Yet when planted, itgrows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birdsof the air can perch in its shade.*(Mark 4:26-28, 31-32)
 
The group of Muslims started off small but grew quickly to become an internationalforce. However, the main point we need to see is that this is one of ten Koranicreferences which couple the *Law* and the *Gospel* closely together, implyingthat the totality of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures can be summed up in the phrase"the Law and the Gospel". One more example:
 
Another interesting verse. It states that the coming of the Prophet is prophesied inthe Book of the Jews, and in the Book of the Christians. From the Torah, Muslims usuallyrefer to Deut. 18:15 as indicating Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh),
 
It is explained that only Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) qualifies to fulfill this because thephrase, "from among your own brothers" is taken to mean "from among thosewho are brothers to you Jews, that is, Ishmaelites for example". They see it assignificant that the Prophet was not a Jew. As far as Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) beingprophesied in the *Injil* goes, it is helpful to look at another Koranic verse:
 
This verse does not have the word *Injil* or *Gospel* but it does give theidea that news of the coming of Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh) is in the *Injil*. This versealso reinforces the "law and gospel" couplet pattern in the Koran. Muslimscholars look to an emended version of verses in John's Gospel to support this Koranicstatement:
 
*"Ahmad", or "Muhammad", the Praised One, is almost a translationof the Greek word Periclytos. In the present Gospel of John, xiv. 16, xv. 26, and xvi. 7,the word "Comforter" in the English version is for the Greek word"Paracletos", which means "Advocate", "one called to the help ofanother, a kind friend", rather than "Comforter". Our doctors contend thatParacletos is a corrupt reading for Periclytos, and that in their original saying of Jesusthere was a prophecy of our holy Prophet Ahmad by name. Even if we read Paraclete, itwould apply to the holy Prophet, who is "a Mercy for all creatures" (xxi. 107)and "most kind and merciful to the Believers" (ix. 128).* (Ali, *Ibid.*,pg. 1540, footnote.)
 
*The point here is not what Muhammad [pbuh]thought the Injil to be...but what in factit was at his time. He is, in the above passage, exhorting the Christians of his day tolook into the Injil for guidance. Now, if these Christians had responded to such anexhortation and had looked into their Injil or evangel into what would they have looked?The answer is quite obvious: They would have looked into their New Testament (which isalso ours)...*(Nazer-Ali, Islam: A Christian Perspective, pg. 14.)
 
*Abu Huraira told that when God's messenger once asked Ubayy b. Ka'b how he recitedin the course of the prayer and he recited Umm al-Qur'an [the first surah of the Koran],he said, "By Him in whose hand my soul is, nothing like it has been sent down in **the***
 
This tradition neatly encapsulates the Muslim belief in four heavenly books. The Koranmentions no other such heavenly books, but it does mention biblical prophets who are notcontained in the Pentateuch, Psalms, or New Testament.
 
This verse leaves open the possibility of other Scripture which is not included in the*Tawrat* and the *Injil*. Surely more must be intended than just the *Zabur*and
