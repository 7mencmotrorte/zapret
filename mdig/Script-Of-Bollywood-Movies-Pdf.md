Movie scripts are the foundation upon which the entire filmmaking process is built. They outline the storyline, develop characters, and provide dialogue that actors bring to life on screen. For any aspiring screenwriter, scripts of released movies are an essential tool for education. A well-written script sets the tone, establishes the mood, and lays the groundwork for the visual and auditory elements of every movie.

While Bollywood movie scripts are not as readily available as those from Hollywood, there are still avenues where enthusiasts can access them. Some production houses and filmmakers release scripts as part of promotional materials or special editions via books.
 
Over the years, Bollywood scripts have evolved to reflect changing audience preferences and societal trends. While traditional Bollywood films were often characterized by melodrama, song-and-dance sequences, and formulaic plots, contemporary scripts showcase a more diverse range of genres, storytelling techniques, and thematic depth. Filmmakers are experimenting with unconventional narratives, complex characters, and socially relevant themes, paving the way for a new era of Bollywood cinema.
 
It's not always so different. There are just a set of rules in hollywood, there isn't really in bollywood. So in bollywood you write as you please and so sometimes it looks more like the hollywood-style, one minute per page format, and other times like a stage-play-script. Sometimes in bollywood there is no dialogue but just a treatment and then someone else is brought in to write the dialogue, sometimes on the spot. But if you for example read the script of "ek main aur ekk tu" you'll see it's quite alike. In bollywood there is also a tradition of narrating the script to producers and actors so as long as the writer/director understands it it's often enough. While in hollywood sometimes a lot of writers work on the same script, due to the studio-system, so there is a greater need for every script to be formated the same. In hollywood it is also more common to have a writer and a separate director, who don't work together at all.Hope it answered your question :)

Very good post especially the counter-point by Samit Basu, provides a more complete viewpoint. In the New Bollywood that everyone is talking about scripts seem to be important or so i have read. I can only hope that aspiring writers that are salivating on the sidelines with ideas and stories have a fair shot at thier dreams and this whole business of Bollywood Changing is not bogus PR to sell courses and workshops.

Dear Venita
 It was really inspiring to read your views for the script. I was actually planning to write a movie script and to convince any big star, but I was de-motivated to see the different views of many people. And by chance I crossed your blog, and it helped me a lot and motivated me to move forward. thanks a lot dear.

anyone who is keen to learn script writing course can attend New York Film Academy 4 week course or Manhattan Film Academy shortest course for two days. This is in UAE not sure about India though. I have done a course from New York FA and it's fantastic. I am writing for years as my hobby but how to convert your story into a screen play is really not very tough. you may start reading online on how to make a structure etc..
 
I am a student but nowadays I'd written the story, and I'm just written a very good story. Which is based at the underworld, and I want the story became a movie which was written by me. We have full confidence that you will give us an opportunity to present their talent in front of you.

suppose you are filming A case: your hero has boosted his business with getting A foriegn outsourced project,THEN ITS VERY GOOD TO ALSO PICTURIZE IN NEXT SCENE A TWO LINES OF NEWS WHICH DESCRIBING THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO SO WHILE THE OUTSOURCING HAS BEEN JUST BANNED THAT EVENING.

THAT DO NOT REQUIRE EXPLICITLY YOU TO PICTURIZE THAT YOUR HERO WAS LUCKy (or unlucky) ALSO!THIS KIND OF SHARP IDENTIFICATION OF BACKGROUND INDUCTION CAN SUPPORT IN MAKING YOUR INITIAL THEME CONSTRUCTIVE.

BYE FOR NOW!

Are you guys kidding yourselves? Most of you, I guarantee you, will not even know the fundamentals of a good story. India produces these wannabes by the dozen, each claiming to be a super talent. Has any of you even tried narrating your story to a live audience to get a reaction? Can you hold the interest of a group that does not know you for 3 hours? If not, stop writing crap about your storytelling abilities. 99 out of 100 who claim to be "writers" cannot differentiate between the noun and the verb. In any case, does it look like Bollywood knows anything about storytelling? Why even try?
