A **Bangalore torpedo** is an explosive charge placed within one or several connected tubes. It is used by combat engineers to clear obstacles that would otherwise require them to approach directly, possibly under fire. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a "Bangalore mine", "banger" or simply "Bangalore" as well as a **pole charge**.
 
The Bangalore torpedo was devised by Captain R. L. McClintock[2] of the Royal Engineers while attached to the Madras Sappers and Miners unit of the Indian Army at Bangalore, India, in 1912. He invented it as a means of blowing up booby traps and barricades left over from the Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War.[3] The Bangalore torpedo could be exploded over a mine, without a sapper having to approach closer than about 3 m (10 ft).

Bangalore torpedoes were manufactured until 2017 by Mondial Defence Systems of Poole, UK, for the UK and US armed forces.[4] An improved version called the Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo (APBT) was developed by Chemring Energetics UK, part of the Chemring Group, in response to a British Ministry of Defence (MOD) requirement issued in 2008. The APBT was chosen by the MOD following competitive performance trials and is used by the militaries of Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.[5] They were used during the Afghanistan War for actions such as clearing mines or razor wire.[6]
 
In World War I the Bangalore torpedo was primarily used for clearing barbed wire before an attack. It could be used while under fire, from a protected position in a trench. The torpedo was standardized to consist of a number of externally identical 1.5 m (5 ft) lengths of threaded pipe, one of which contained the explosive charge. The pipes would be screwed together using connecting sleeves to make a longer pipe of the required length, somewhat like a chimney brush or drain clearing rod.
 
A smooth nose cone was screwed on the end to prevent snagging on the ground. It was pushed forward from a protected position and detonated, to clear a 1.5 m (5 ft) wide hole through barbed wire. During the 1917 Battle of Cambrai, British Royal Engineers used them as diversions to distract the enemy from where the real battle was to be fought.[7]
 
It was widely used by the U.S. Army, notably during the D-Day landings. The Bangalore torpedo was obsolete in British use at the time of D-Day, having been replaced by rocket-launched Congers and Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) vehicles equipped with a 40-pound (18 kg) explosive charge for bunker clearing.[*citation needed*]
 
Bangalore torpedoes continue to be used today in the little-changed M1A2 and M1A3[12] versions of the United States Armed Forces, and the modified Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo version of the British Armed Forces and Australian Defence Force, under the L26A1 designation which is also used by Chemring,[13][14][15] primarily to breach wire obstacles.

Combat engineers have been known to construct similar field versions of the Bangalore by assembling segments of metal picket posts and filling the concave portion with plastic explosive (PE).[*citation needed*] The PE is then primed with detonating cord and a detonator, and pickets are taped or wired together to make a long torpedo, producing fragments (aka "shrapnel") that cut the wire when detonated. This method produces results similar to the standard-issue Bangalore, and can be assembled to the desired length by adding picket segments.
 
Newer Bangalore variants include the Alford Technologies Bangalore Blade and the Chemring Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo (APBT), with both developed in the United Kingdom. The Bangalore Blade is made from lightweight aluminium and is configured as a linear explosively formed projectile (EFP) array capable of cutting wire obstacles, which earlier Bangalore variants were incapable of breaching effectively. The improvements introduced with the Bangalore Blade give the charge a cutting action as well as a blasting effect.[16]
 
In a test detonation conducted on the television show *Future Weapons*, the Bangalore Blade blasted a gap roughly five meters wide in concertina wire, and created a trench deep enough to detonate most nearby anti-personnel mines. Alford Technologies' web page for the Bangalore Blade cites additional trial detonations involving two identical triple-razor wire entanglements erected between steel pickets. A Bangalore torpedo conforming to the original design cleared a three-metre path, while the Bangalore Blade cleared a ten-metre path.[17]
 
The Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo uses an aluminium body and is filled with two kilograms of DPX1 high density pressed explosive. A unique and patented design feature is incorporated which, in combination with the DPX1 explosive, provides enhanced blast and fragmentation effects which provide an enhanced cutting capability against both simple and complex wire entanglements. The APBT is capable of cutting through up to six millimetres of steel plating.[18]
 
Up to eight APBTs can be combined with one another, with the resulting assembly capable of defeating obstacles that are up to eight metres in length. The quick-turn thread used for this purpose has been designed for ease of assembly when contaminated with sand, soil, or mud while being strong enough to ensure reliable deployment of connected charges without inadvertent decoupling.[19] The APBT has an improved Insensitive Munition signature compared to preceding in-service designs.[20]
 
Soldiers from 3rd Platoon, 66th Engineer Company, demonstrate the use of a Bangalore torpedo during the demonstration of an in-stride breach for Japan Ground Self-Defense Force partners at Aibano Training Area, Shiga, Japan, during exercise Orient Shield 12. Orient Shield 12 is a two-week, tactical level bilateral exercise designed to enhance interoperability between U.S. and Japanese units at the lowest levels.
 
About 6 months after acquiring a set of original Bangalore torpedo connectors and the rare nose piece, I started looking for ways to make a complete set. Getting the proper metal pipes, paints and stencils took some time. But this weekend, I finally set about my restoration project. I am quite pleased with the result, if I do say so myself.
 
I used a connector on both ends of one pipe, and a connector and head piece for the other one. Let me know if you need detail pics of the original terminal ends. I should have them somewhere. It will be difficult to reproduce because the pipe is tapered on one end.
 
To me the difference between percentages are reasonable, considering that one is an explosive tube that any equipped / low trained soldier just have to put under the obstacle or on the minefield, the other requires some skills for the use of equipment such as pliers / scissors and mine detector for minefield, and engineers have specific training for this.
 
Another difference is that manual mine clearing is affected by the pins, detonate the bangalore or explosive is not affected by the pins (2d6 or 3d6 hits is not affected by pins), except for the order test.

The Bangalore Torpedo is designed to produce a continuous line charge for breaching barbed wire obstacles, clearing the minefields and other explosive devices. The standard charge consists of 4 pieces of 6ft torpedoes connected by connection pieces. Bangalores shrapnel effect after its detonation clears a wire or an explosive obstacle.

We did obviously discuss the thought that the PBI did not fancy carrying a large tub of explosive out into a hail of small arms and artillery shells! but surely this would not have been paramont on High Commands minds if it would have done the job!
 
This thing was a long series of pipes that looked about the size of water pipes with a very large head on the end. It was something that could have been gradually pushed out from a trench, but definitely not something you could run up a beach with.
 
When I first visited the Newfoundland Park 25+ years ago, there were bangalore torpedoes lying in shell holes close to the German wire - probably very close to where they were dropped in 1916. The 29th Division war diaries make mention of them being carried in the assault waves, but I think so few ever got close to the wire, they were not used.
 
I've seen acouple of mentions of Bangalore Torpedoes being used out in Salonika. I believe there is even a cartoon in the 107th Field Company's history of an NCO carrying one of these on his way to winning a MM.
 
By the time of WW2 the pipes were about 40mm diameter. Like a set of plumbers drain rods, they were attached together one by one and extended in this way under the wire before detonation. Better explosives available I expect.
 
The CRE 51st Division submitted a paper dated 6 Sep 1916 regarding an experiment with torpedoes made from both sheet iron and various diameters of waterpipe. This was later promulgated as 'E in C Fieldworks Notes No. 6'.
