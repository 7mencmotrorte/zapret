I remember the guy I was meeting was late and this was in the days before cell phones were completely ubiquitous, so I went across the street to have lunch. After, I came back and my friend had arrived so we played a few rounds of games. My Dad told me that he went to see the dancing chicken years before and was sad to hear it was no longer there.
 
I love the streets in chinatown , there the only streets that giuliani, and goddam bloomberg havent fucked up to make it more friendly to transplants , its the only place where i can still go and visit places of my youth and nothing has changed

It was in much, much better shape. At the time, there was a little Chinatown museum attached to the place. It was closed on the day we went. It was near the rear and to the left . . . up a flight of stairs?
 
I remember the original, larger place across the street. They had a captive Dragon in the basement that you could see by putting some money into a slot that would open up a window you could look down.
 
I grew up playing with that chicken. We would have dinner at Nom Wah tea parlor, get a fish shaped cookie from Golden Fung Wah bakery, and then go to the arcade. I was bummed when they got rid of the chicken. However, I discovered in a trip to Mexico that the maker of the of the chicken tic tac toe machine had others. There was a bunny that rode a tiny fire engine and turned on the siren, a duck that came out behind a curtain, turned on a lamp and played a tiny piano, and there was a guinea pig but I dont remember what he did. And more tic tac toe chickens. I was probably the most excited 6 year old you have ever seen with a handful of pesos.
 
Wonderful story! I recently found out that my favorite neighborhood arcade in New Orleans from when I was a kid actually managed to survive into the 21st century, and finally closed just a couple of years ago. Brought a tear to my eye.

I remember the old Chinatown Fair at 7-9 Mott. As a kid it was amazing! No video games then, but there were rides and skee-ball. The best part was a kind of peep show in the back; you would put in a nickel, the shade would open and you would see a dragon in a dimly lit cave! The head moved and the eyes lit up and it roared!There were even bat flying around. I really miss those days!
 
i remember this place crap i went here from 1990 to 2000 it was the spot no cops would bother me and my lil crew of friends from cutting class and getting some gaming on i will miss this place as i was hoping to take my son and teach him the ropes thanks for the memories
 
I am planning my first trip to NY in march with my girlfriend and this was the first place to visit on my list. After a quick search to find the exact address I found this site that has photos showing its now closed? Very annoying as I have wanted to visit this place since you first posted this article
