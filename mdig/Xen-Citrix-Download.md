I am using a brand new Lenovo Thinkpad and am working from within a virtual desktop in Citrix. I tested the camera outside my virtual desktop works fine for MS Teams and Zoom. Within the virtual desktop, I cannot see people nor be seen - there is not even a button to turn on the video. Also, I have not button to share my screen nor can I see other people sharing theirs.

I have installed Zoom VDI (latest version 5.8.x), latest version of Citrix Workspace and latest version of Zoom itself - still not success. I tried accessing the virtual desktop from another laptop, everything works perfectly fine.
 
I checked my anit-virus sofware called bitdefender. It detects the use of the microphone as Citrix HDX Engine. I can hear people and people can hear me. So that at least works. The anit-virus software does not recognise the camera inside Citrix - but it does recognise the camera for both MS Teams and Zoom OUTSIDE the citrix virtual desktop.
