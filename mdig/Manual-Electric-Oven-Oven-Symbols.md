The way you use an oven depends on the appliance's type and setup, including whether it's conventional, convection, gas or electric. The number of racks and different types of features also factor into how you can use your oven to make meals and heat leftovers.

At the moment, cooking and baking at home is a bit hit and miss, normally I'd blame my skills in the kitchen, but this time its not my fault- the place I am flatting in has an oven that is probably older than I am. It still runs just fine, but over the years the symbols on the front panel have all almost completely rubbed off, including the model number.
 
The left function knob appears to be 10 clicks to full rotation, which means it has 9 functions + off setting. I found a few others on google which had 5-6-7 type arrangements, but nothing else. Brand is Classique.
 
You might be able to find a model number on the inner door, though I think this depends on the brands as it might not be there at times. But if you can find it, you should be able to find a manual on the Classique website, or email them to send you a copy.
 
Thanks for the info mate- unfortunately this appears to be for the 10 function oven and I have the 9. From what I can tell, it looks like the order of the functions is different (turned on to a couple to test).
 
Interesting, was it far off? 
The manual I was sent doesn't appear to have the dial actually listed in the manual itself, they just sent me a seperate picture of the front.. so I wonder if that is the same as whats your manual or not?
 
All modern **ovens** now come with a number of cooking symbols and functions, some of which you may not be familiar with. Generally these symbols can be seen on a range of manufactures so it is useful to make some sense of them, whatever kind of cook you are. As a global leader in **built-in ovens** including **compact ovens** and **double ovens**, we know a thing or two about them and their many symbols. Ensuring the right function or oven setting is used will guarantee the best cooking results and create delicious meals time after time.
 
To help make your life easier this Bosch oven symbols guide covers a range of oven symbols from grilling to cleaning, helping save you time and effort when cooking. Read on to find out how to use your oven.
 
This fan oven symbol means that you can place your food on any of the four shelfs to achieve consistently perfect results: thanks to the fan wheel that changes direction of rotation during operation to distribute heat evenly on every level.
 
Select this oven grill symbol if you want to grill large quantities with ease thanks to the precise temperature control. For added efficiency the door can be closed and the smells are kept in the oven.
 
The single point meat probe constantly measures the temperature at the core of the roast and as soon as the desired temperature is reached gives an acoustic and switches off automatically. (Available in selected Serie 6 models only)
 
Three highly sensitive measuring points determine the core temperature of your food to the exact degree, guaranteeing perfect roasting results and taking away the guesswork. (Available in selected Serie 8 models only)

We can probably all agree that today, ovens are an indispensable piece of technology that no kitchen (or cook, for that matter) can live without. But while wiring these powerful pizza and cake factories to your power grid is a challenge in and of itself, your troubles are in no way over.
 
In fact, you may have already learned this first-hand right after a fresh kitchen installation or total refurbishment since oven manufacturers have the infuriating habit of explaining each function in strings of cryptic letters and symbols within their written instructions.
 
For instance, proper usage along with regular oven valeting will ensure that your appliance will last you a few extra years after your warranty expires. You will also avoid expensive and potentially life-threatening mishaps, such as tripping circuit breakers or blown fuses, that will surely leave your appliance in need of professional oven repair. Bear in mind, that to repair your SMEG oven is not something you should neglect and when it comes to fixing an electric oven, only a certified electrician can guarantee the excellence of results.
 
If you are a person who cannot imagine a world without sausages and bacon, this function is all you really need. It is also suitable for cooking small to medium meat portions, as well as for browning off the top of lasagne and other irresistible delicacies.
 
Set up this way, the grill will only emanate heat from its centre, making this function suitable for cooking smaller food portions. For best results, make sure to position smaller items (sausages, cheese toasts, etc.) at the upper shelves, while keeping larger foods on the lower shelves.
 
With this setting on, the fan will attenuate the otherwise significant heat coming from the grill. This allows you to easily grill a variety of meats and other foods. We recommend using the top two shelves of the oven for grilling and the one at the bottom for heating up cool dishes.
 
Here, the air inside the oven is heated at a constant 40C, creating the perfect environment for proving yeast-type dough for bread, coffee cakes, and whatever else you have planned for the upcoming party. Just turn the setting on, place the dough in the special cavity and bake away.
 
If you want to have full control over every cooking process, feel free to try this setting out. With it enabled, you can control the temperature inside the oven with a precision margin of 2-3 C, ensuring that heat-sensitive meals, like cakes and puddings, will turn out just fine.
 
Cleaning your **wall oven** or **range oven** doesn't have to be a huge chore anymore because your oven comes with a self-clean function to handle all of the heavy work. Some models also come with other cleaning modes as well, such as Steam Cleaning or Descaling. After that, all that's left is to clean the racks and the exterior and give it all a good wipe down.
 
**Warning:** Failure to follow these precautions could result in damage to the oven, fire, and/or personal injury. Follow basic precautions when installing and using this range to reduce the risk of fire, electrical shock, injury, or death to persons, including:
 
Do not use oven cleaners. Commercial oven cleaners or oven liners should NEVER be used in or around any part of the oven. Residue from oven cleaners will damage the inside of the oven during a self-cleaning operation.
 
Do not line the oven, oven racks, or oven bottom with aluminum foil. Doing so will result in poor heat distribution, produce poor baking results, and cause permanent damage to the oven interior. The aluminum foil wi
