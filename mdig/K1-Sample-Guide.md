The company I work for did not install the sample.zip file of sample SAS enterprise guide 5.1 data sets so I can use them to learn SAS enterprise guide better. Where can I obtain the sample.zip file that was not installed please? Can someone give me the link for the location so I can download that zip file? Debra

Yes, base SAS 9.3 is installed. SAS enterprise guide and base SAS operate from the hard drive on the desktop. I work in Dept of Defense and the IT staff did not install the sample.zip file so I want to obtain that from SAS's web page if I may. How do I do that? What web page should I go to? Or are there other SAS sample data sets available so I can have clean, well-scrubbed data to illustrate various statistical tests to my students? Debra
 
So if you're doing statistical procedures you can create the datasets by running the code. All of the sample code and data required can be found online, or via your installation. See the links included in the thread below.

This page contains sample papers formatted in seventh edition APA Style. The sample papers show the format that authors should use to submit a manuscript for publication in a professional journal and that students should use to submit a paper to an instructor for a course assignment. You can download the Word files to use as templates and edit them as needed for the purposes of your own papers.
 
Most guidelines in the Publication Manual apply to both professional manuscripts and student papers. However, there are specific guidelines for professional papers versus student papers, including professional and student title page formats. All authors should check with the person or entity to whom they are submitting their paper (e.g., publisher or instructor) for guidelines that are different from or in addition to those specified by APA Style.
 
The following two sample papers were published in annotated form in the Publication Manual and are reproduced here as PDFs for your ease of use. The annotations draw attention to content and formatting and provide the relevant sections of the Publication Manual (7th ed.) to consult for more information.
 
These sample papers demonstrate APA Style formatting standards for different student paper types. Students may write the same types of papers as professional authors (e.g., quantitative studies, literature reviews) or other types of papers for course assignments (e.g., reaction or response papers, discussion posts), dissertations, and theses.
 
APA does not set formal requirements for the nature or contents of an APA Style student paper. Students should follow the guidelines and requirements of their instructor, department, and/or institution when writing papers. For instance, an abstract and keywords are not required for APA Style student papers, although an instructor may request them in student papers that are longer or more complex. Specific questions about a paper being written for a course assignment should be directed to the instructor or institution assigning the paper.
 
Although published articles differ in format from manuscripts submitted for publication or student papers (e.g., different line spacing, font, margins, and column format), articles published in APA journals provide excellent demonstrations of APA Style in action.
 
APA journals began publishing papers in seventh edition APA Style in 2020. Professional authors should check the author submission guidelines for the journal to which they want to submit their paper for any journal-specific style requirements.

This guide is intended to help users optimize sample preparation for stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, specifically when using the STED microscope from Leica Microsystems. It gives an overview of fluorescent labels used for single color STED imaging and a ranking of their performance.
 
Voter guides provide background information on the candidates and ballot measures. They list who you can vote for and offer details on each candidate's experience and goals. They also explain ballot measures, which are specific questions or issues that you can approve or reject.
 
Sample ballots simply show you the elections and candidates and any ballot measures that will be on your real ballot. They will not provide information about the candidates like voter guides do. Your state may mail you a sample ballot or let you download one from its election site. The sample ballot may look exactly like the real one will.
 
You can bring your notes, a voter's guide, or a sample ballot into the voting booth. This frees you from having to memorize your choices for candidates and ballot initiatives. Some polling places do restrict cell phone use, so bring paper copies instead of using your phone. Check the rules with your local election office before you go.

Sample size estimation is an overlooked concept and rarely reported in diagnostic accuracy studies, primarily because of the lack of information of clinical researchers on when and how they should estimate sample size. In this review, readers will find sample size estimation procedures for diagnostic tests with dichotomized outcomes, explained by clinically relevant examples in detail. We hope, with the help of practical tables and a free online calculator ( ), researchers can estimate accurate sample sizes without a need to calculate from equations, and use this review as a practical guide to estimating sample size in diagnostic accuracy studies.
 
This document provides a template to right holders for preparing a product identification guide which can be submitted to CBP and posted on CBP's internal website. CBP uses the document to help make authentication determinations of suspect shipments.
 
The purpose of these sample test materials is to orient faculty and students to the nature of the test content and test questions on the FCLE. The content included in the Supplemental Guide is not intended to replace associated coursework or other preparation methods required to demonstrate civic literacy, as described in Florida Statute. The sample questions and answers are not intended to demonstrate the length of the actual test. Student performance on the sample items should not be used as a predictor of performance on the actual test, and neither the sample items nor the supplemental guide should be used to guide classroom instruction.

This Sample Preparation guide is intended to provide specific and highly detailed information about certain elements in regards to sample preparation. In contrast, my previous guides, Trace Analysis: A Guide for Attaining Reliable Measurements and ICP Operations: A Guide for Using ICP-OES and ICP-MS, have dealt with the theory and basics of the common sample preparation techniques.
 
The information presented for each of the elements will include preparation and solution chemistry of samples containing the element. Preparation methods will be given for common chemical forms and for several sample types. Chemical incompatibilities and tendencies will also be addressed, as well as hydrolytic stability data and preferred matrices.

Below you will find scoring guides and samples of student work for released items from the spring 2023 MCAS tests. Scoring guides and student work samples are provided for the following item types: constructed-response items and essay questions. In addition, annotations are included at all score points with the student work samples for ELA essay questions.
 
With only a few exceptions, at least two different samples of student work have been included at the highest score point for all grades and subjects to show that students may achieve a top score even if they approach an essay question differently or arrive at a correct answer to a constructed-response item using an alternate method.
