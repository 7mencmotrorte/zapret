This might help. 
I was installing Desktop development with C++ via Visual Studio Installer. On the error popup with message "Couldn't install Microsoft.VisualCpp.Redist.14.Latest" there is View Logs option. 
Error log should state: "Error opening installation log file. Verify that the specified log file location exists and that you can write to it." 
Installation log file location should be C:\Users[user]\AppData\Local\Temp. Give everyone rights to Temp folder: right click on the Temp folder -> Properties -> Security tab -> Edit -> Add -> type Everyone -> click on Check Names -> OK -> check Full control -> Apply -> OK -> OK. 
Error log contains name of the installation log and it should be something like this: dd\_setup\_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\_001\_Microsoft.VisualCpp.Redist.14.Latest.log. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx part should represent date and time ,for example 20220812175204. In the Temp folder find the given installation log file and check if Everyone has full control over it, similarly as previously described. It should be so, but if not, set it yourself. 
I think each installation try has its own installation log, with specific date and time in installation log's name and Everyone doesn't have full control over that new log, as it is created after full control is given to everyone, but I am not sure. Therefore, failed installation's step should be continued. 
Error log contains one more path. That is path to installation file. The path should be something like: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Packages\Microsoft.VisualCpp.Redist.14.Latest,version=xx.xx.xxxxx,chip=x86. Open that location. There should be an application named something like VC\_redist.x86. Run it.
