If your child has 2-Step Verification turned on for their account and you change their password, 2-Step Verification will be turned off and an extra layer of security will be removed from their account.

I am trying to set up an invite-only application based on the following auth0 tutorial: -invite-only-applications#summary. The email verification endpoint worked as expected however the password reset endpoint is not sending an email. I have set up my own email client, the Auth0 Lock password reset is working and I received a 404 Not Found response when I attempted to implement this fix Issue with password reset mail not being sent. Could you please help, thank you.
 
@hhdev For the verify user email with password reset are you referring to this -user-email-with-password-reset.md ? Because that will mark the user as verified as soon as they reset the password. So it only runs after the next time they login (after password reset is successful). What email provider are you using?
 
Is this issue any closer to being resolved, as stated in the original question, I am receiving password reset emails when I reset my password through the Auth0 Lock but no email is sent when the \_AUTH0\_DOMAIN/api/v2/tickets/password-change API endpoint is it even though it returns a valid password reset URL in its response.
 
So I have created a lot of automations for my customer and each of these automations has connection with the gmail app (especially the send an email module).
Each time tha customer change its gmail password, all these scenarios are broken and I should go myself to each scenario and connect every module of gmail again.

I have two Gmail accounts and changed both passwords. There is no place in Mail or Internet Accounts to change it. I found one post that said we have to delete and re-add the account. I sure hope this isn't accurate.
 
There is no way to enter or change the password any more, in mail or in System Prefs, internet accounts. You can delete and reenter the account but the account keeps going inactive over and over. Nobody really knows what to do?
 
Yep, that's the brilliance of modern Apple Mail. You have to trigger it to tell you the password is incorrect, either by waiting for it to occur, sending an email, etc. Then when it asks you can change it. Other than deleting and re-creating, this is the only way I've found.
 
Thanks - this was driving me bananas! I could list any number of completely non-sensical and anti-intuitive inconsistencies throughout Apple's operating systems that they really should have got a handle on by now. Especially frustrating is the proper lack of integration between comms apps Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes and Tasks. As much as I hate to say it, Outlook beats it hands down in this respect. I think that Apple should send regular surveys to users to find out what improvements are actually needed, instead of tinkering around in the dark, trying to fix what ain't broken, and making baffling changes that users have to then find workarounds to fix.
 
Click on the Advanced tab; you will see a box for Authentication: It will probably say None. Click on the arrows icon in that box and choose Password. The contents of the Advanced tab will change and allow you to put in a password. Click the OK button, and you are done.
 
Finally, some folks are finding if under the "Mailboxes" Menu in Mail, if they click on "Take all Accounts Offline" then wait a minute, then Turn All Accounts Online this helps. Seems to disconnect and then reconnect with the servers.
 
None of the above helped me; I was never prompted for a new password - there was no password box under by name, either. I had to use Mail Preferences-->Accounts-->Gmail-->Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)-->Edit SMTP Server list-->Advanced to change it there, and it changed it for incoming messages as well. Seems extremely unintuitive but at least it worked.
 
Namely, I don't use gmail in any of my outgoing parameters, and to "suppose" the smtp account is the same as the incoming account might be accurate in most cases, but not all cases (This is the very reason most mail clients have separate incoming and outgoing credentials fields).
 
In my case, making the assumption they are all and one same got me in troubles when upgrading to El Capitan (my email, incoming, and ongoing parameters are 3 separate adresses, by design) : It scrapped most of my settings and replaced under the assumption they were all the same one.
 
Here again, it seems mail doesn't care if it's an account for imap.google.com or smtp.google.com and slaps the same credentials to both, making change to one of them effectively (but wrongly) changing the other one.
 
The quickest fix for me was to go to accounts under Mail Preferences, highlight the account, delete the account by hitting the - (minus sign), and then just add a new email account by setting up Gmail as a Google account selection. It took a whole 2 minutes to get all my emails back in my inbox.
 
Try to send an email using Apple Mail for the gmail account that you cannot change the password for. When you hit the send button, a popup box will come up while in Apple Mail, it will take you to a login box for that gmail account - you can enter your password there.
 
Thanks for this, axio7. But there is a race condition in Apple Mail. In my case I saw my account go offline after I changed my Gmail password via my browser. So At that point I could not have even sent an email from the account as it had gone offline
 
Hi! I created my account back in 2016-2017 and I didn't use it for a while. I changed my phone since then and now I can't login because I don't remember my password. When I try to reset it, it says that the reset email was sent but I didn't receive anything. I tried looking into the spam folder and creating a contact with no-reply@dropbox.com but nothing worked. I know this is the right email because I got a lot of mails from dropbox about my account saying that my account storage is full and I should upgrade.

I was looking through the emails I received in all these years from dropbox and like 1-2 years ago they said that they deleted my account due to my innactivity, but after that email, I still got other emails saying that my memory was full and I should upgrade my plan. So my question is: is it not closed?
 
I have a similar issue. I am trying to set up Dropbox on a second device but cannot remember password. Have requested a email to the email address that is in my profile multiple times but have not received it. It is not in my junk or spam folders and I have added Dropbox to my address book.
 
I can't delete my account because I don't remember the password.
When I try to reset password - I don't get an email.
I have access to the account - via Google Sign In
How can I delete an account?
