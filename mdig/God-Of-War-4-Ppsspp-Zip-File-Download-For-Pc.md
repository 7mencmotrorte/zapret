The ppsspp doesn't came with Wayland/Vulkan support, but the buiild can be configured to enable Wayland/Vulkan support by setting -DUSE\_WAYLAND\_WSI=ON. I tried that but all I end up with is a blank/nil window in Sway WM (no window at all in Weston).

I've opened an issue upstream to get support from the maintainers ( ), but I thought I would try the Arch Linux forum too as someone might have managed to make it run properly on Arch. Native Wayland support seems to work with the OpenGL backend as long as you install glew-wayland instead of glew.
 
**This page is for PPSSPP, a standalone emulator. This page is not for the PPSSPP RetroArch core. For more information on RetroArch and the PPSSPP RetroArch core, visit the RetroArch Page.**

PPSSPP is a fairly straight-forward emulator to set up. Place your ROMs in Emulation/roms/psp. No additional setup is required. Read the Configuration section to learn more about PPSSPP and its folder locations.
 
These file locations apply regardless of where you chose to install EmuDeck (to your internal SSD, to your SD Card, or elsewhere). Some emulator configuration files will be located on the internal SSD as listed below.
 
Paths beginning with Emulation/.. correspond to your EmuDeck install location. If you installed on an SD Card, your path may be /run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/roms/... If you installed on your internal SSD, your path may be /home/deck/Emulation/roms/..
 
The PPSSPP Flatpak (installed by EmuDeck) does not use a named Memstick folder to manage its contents. Instead, the Memstick folder is located here: /home/deck/.var/app/org.ppsspp.PPSSPP/config/ppsspp/PSP.
 
Typically, the shader packs linked above will include a master INI file which will contain a set of good defaults that expand the repository of shaders you can use in PPSSPP. However, you can create custom INI files to mix and match shaders. This section will cover how to do that.
 
Your custom shader will now be created. To enable it, open PPSSPP, click Settings, click the Graphics tab on the left, click Display layout & effects, click the + button under Postprocessing shaders and select your newly created custom shader
 
If you do not have access to a mouse and keyboard for the below section, use L2 to right click and R2 to left click. Alternatively, remote into your Steam Deck using one of the methods found in the FAQ, How do I remotely control my Steam Deck?.
 
If the above steps did not work and you are getting an error message along the lines of Flatpak not installed, your Flatpak is likely installed at the system level instead. Select one of the below solutions:
 
Solution 2: Add sudo in front of the commands written in Step 2 and Step 5. In Step 2, write sudo flatpak remote-info --log flathub org.ppsspp.PPSSPP and in Step 5, write sudo flatpak update --commit=put\_commit\_code\_here org.ppsspp.PPSSPP.
 
Flatpak is an universal Linux package format runs in sandbox. It comes with most dependency libraries bundled, and takes **a few hundred MB more disk space** than native .deb package from Ubuntu PPA.
 
The PPSSPP Flatpak supports both modern **64-bit AMD/Intel PC** and **AArch64 processor, such as Raspberry Pi and Apple Silicon**. And the package is maintained and updated timely by the community, consists of Linux developers.
 
> , it has upside including auto-update and multi-arch support!
misleading.
a proper .deb/ppa also has auto-update integrated with your system.
and why would you want to have binaries for an architecture you dont use? a proper ppa again will have binaries for each architecture it supports (not sure if this is the case for ppsspp).
