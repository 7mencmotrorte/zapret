Yet I dropped my guard and let the $1,400 2-in-1 entice me with its looks, only to find that everything else about it is merely … OK. Despite the laptop's solid, Core i7-based performance and good speakers, I couldn't force myself to love the shallow keyboard, the low-resolution webcam or the short battery life. The ZenBook Flip S is more than usable, but it's not as luxurious as I expected when first I laid my eyes on it.

The ZenBook Flip S is derivative of Asus' other laptops of late, like the ZenBook 3 Deluxe. I'm OK with that, because the Flip S, like the Deluxe, is really damn gorgeous. The aluminum, navy-blue construction is rock-solid, and its gold accents scream luxury. The lid features Asus' trademark concentric circles with the Asus logo in gold in the center.
 
Unfolding the notebook reveals the 13-inch, 1080p display, a navy blue deck and an island-style keyboard with gold lettering. The Flip is a 2-in-1, meaning it can be used as a laptop, a tablet, a tent (an upside down "V") or a display. Rather than putting the fingerprint reader in the corner of the touchpad (a practice I detest), Asus placed this part on the right side of the laptop, which also makes it accessible regardless of how you're using the laptop.
 
At 2.5 pounds in weight and 0.4 inches thick, the Flip is far lighter than competitors. HP's Spectre x360 is the closest, at 2.9 pounds and 0.5-inches thick; the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga is 3.2 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, and the Samsung Notebook 9 Pro, at 3.8 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, is far heavier than the rest (although it does have discrete graphics).
 
There's a dearth of ports on the Flip. The left side has a single USB-C port and an audio jack, while the right side has one more USB-C port. Keep in mind that you'll use one of these for charging. To provide a few more ports, Asus packs an adapter in the box that expands a single USB-C port to HDMI, USB 3.0 and USB-C. I really wish Asus had opted for Thunderbolt 3 instead of USB-C for faster data transfer; on a $1,400 laptop, the company could afford to do it.

Still, Jessica Chastain's red hair popped against her blue peacoat, and I could make out little specks of gray in Idris Elba's beard. Red playing cards had great contrast against a green betting table.
 
We measured the Flip's keyboard at just 1 millimeter of travel, which is way too flat (we prefer 1.5mm or more). The 63 grams of pressure required to actuate the keys made them feel mushy, and I made typos far too often. On the 10fastfingers.com typing test, I reached 103 words per minute, falling below my 107-wpm average, and I had an error rate of 6 percent, nearly three times my usual 2 percent.
 
The 4.4 x 2.7-inch touchpad is spacious, accurate and smooth. My fingers glided against it, and it was great at picking up gestures like pinching to zoom, swiping to show all of my open apps and tapping to open the action center.
 
The bundled stylus can sense 1,024 levels of pressure, and, for most users, it will work fine for simple inking. One of our in-house artists found that there was a tiny bit of lag, but I don't think that will affect people marking up web pages. The customizable buttons on the pen are a bit high up, but nothing I couldn't get used to.
 
The ZenBook Flip S is tiny, but Asus packed some serious speakers into it. When I listened to Bowling For Soup's "1985," the vocals, guitar and drums filled our meeting room instantly. However, to get the bass, I needed to do some manual tuning.
 
I opened up the ICEpower AudioWizard and, in the advanced settings, pumped up the bass and volume. There are also some presets, but I found that anything besides the default Music mode was too shrieky to enjoy.
 
With its 2.7-GHz Intel Core i7-7500U CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SATA SSD, the ZenBook Flip S has enough power for tab hoarders and multitaskers. I had 25 tabs open in Google Chrome, including one for a 1080p episode of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, and saw no lag at all. Still, this machine consistently lagged behind the competition on many of our performance tests.
 
I wish Asus could've jammed a larger battery into the Flip, because this notebook won't last you through a full day. It endured for 7 hours and 8 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which browses the web continuously over Wi-Fi.
 
I'll be blunt: Asus was cheap on the camera. When you spend $1,400 for a laptop, you should get something with higher resolution than the Flip's 640 x 480 shooter. A photo I took at my desk was bright, but the colors were on the warm side and there was very little detail. My beard looked like a fourth grader had shaded it on my face with a pencil, and I couldn't see any of the color variation in my watchband.
 
The Flip may not have a ton of room for heat to dissipate, but it stays cool nonetheless. After I streamed 15 minutes of 1080p video from YouTube, the bottom of the laptop measured 88 degrees Fahrenheit and the center of the keyboard was 86 degrees.
 
I was surprised by the lack of software on the Flip. Asus usually includes software like the Splendid Utility to adjust the display, but this program wasn't on our review unit. It's easy enough to download the app from Asus' website, but this was a glaring omission.
 
From the outside, the Asus ZenBook Flip S is a stone-cold stunner of a laptop that will turn heads wherever you go. When you get your hands on it, though, it proves to be strictly average at best, with some noticeable flaws in battery life, a flat keyboard and a low-resolution webcam.
 
But let's give it credit where it's due: The speakers are loud and clear, and the display, while on the dim side, offers up a ton of colors. However, for this much money, there's another laptop that stands out from the pack as better in almost every way: the HP Spectre x360. Starting at $1,200, this notebook gives you a brighter display, a faster SSD, more ports and longer battery life, as well as a great, clicky keyboard.
 
Webcams bring new levels of personalization to calls with friends, families, and coworkers. Today, video communication has become bigger than ever. Webcams have seen a huge surge in demand globally due to increases in social media and work from home. People are turning to webcams for their improved video and audio hardware. Today I will be reviewing the **ASUS C3 webcam.** Will this be your next web camera? Check out this review to find out.
 
If you have a laptop with an integrated webcam you might be wondering why anyone would need an external web camera. In the world of cameras, sensor size plays a huge role in image quality. The sensor size of a camera determines how much light it can collect, which has a direct correlation with image quality. While laptops do come equipped with cameras, their small size often results in a lower image quality. On the other hand, external webcams come with larger image sensors leading to a better image quality, colour, and resolution.
 
The ASUS C3 webcam is a mid-tier webcam that provides fantastic video and audio for an affordable price. The C3 comes with a HD 19201080 video resolution at 30 fps, autofocus, and beamforming microphones.
 
If you look closely at the front of the ASUS C3, there are microphones located on the left and right side of the camera. These are beamforming microphones that are meant to reduce the ambient noise while emphasizing your voice. In my tests, the beamforming microphones produced a very loud and clear audio. On video calls, l usually find myself speaking louder so that my audience can hear me clearly. However on the C3, speaking at a normal volume was more than enough. While the Asus C3 uses beamforming microphones, it does not have any noise cancellation technology. This means that listeners will still be able to hear ambient sounds around you, such as fans, and the sound of mechanical keyboards typing.
 
I find that getting fully dressed in professional clothes as if I were actually going into a physical meeting room gets my in the right mindset. That means the bottom half, too, that no one on video sees.
 
I only have a laptop camera, so a few minutes before each teams meeting I have to adjust my desk, move my monitor and open my laptop, adjust the light behind me, and of course make sure my hair looks good ?
 
There are many tips but the most importants are, get a bottle of water ready, a good snack and blur that background because no one wants to see those weird posters in your background! ? Also have good lightning.
 
Something that helps me prepare for a video meeting is setting up my laptop, turning on the camera, and sitting down exactly where I am going to sit during the meeting, so I can make sure my clothes, lighting, internet connection etc. are all acceptable! Then I can call my client and being the meeting.
 
All of that being said, having a cam that works without any setup is key for getting quickly set up for a meeting. Not having to worry about the quality, focus and whether it actually works or not before getting in to it is a HUGE plus.
 
I think it is very important to preview and make sure that everything is running the way it is supposed to be and that the camera is pointing where it should be and nothing distracting showing up in the background
