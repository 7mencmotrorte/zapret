It is important that your ODBC driver's executable and linking format (ELF) is the same as your application. In other words, you need a 32-bit driver for a 32-bit application or a 64-bit driver for a 64-bit application.
 
If these do not match, it is possible to configure a DSN for a 32-bit driver and when you attempt to use that DSN in a 64-bit application, the DSN won't be found because the registry holds DSN information in different places depending on ELF (32-bit versus 64-bit).
 
Be sure you are using the correct ODBC Administrator tool. On 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, the default ODBC Administrator tool is in c:\Windows\System32\odbcad32.exe. However, on a 64-bit Windows machine, the default is the 64-bit version. If you need to use the 32-bit ODBC Administrator tool on a 64-bit Windows system, you will need to run the one found here: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe
 
Where I see this tripping people up is when a user uses the default 64-bit ODBC Administrator to configure a DSN; thinking it is for a 32-bit DSN. Then when the 32-bit application attempts to connect using that DSN, "Data source not found..." occurs.

This was not the first time I have come to this page searching for the same error message. Unfortunately, Microsoft error messages are vague and often several different issues will cause the same error message, hence why there are so many answers here.
 
The problem is that when I am opening an ADODB connection in VBA, and I use this same string, it will produce the "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified" error.
 
Following the instructions here =27099554 I had to install the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable before I had the Excel driver installed to use the DSN-less connection I wanted to use from perl.
 
I had the installed drivers listed in odbcinst -q -d, and could connect manually but not through R's odbc::dbConnect(). Turns out I forgot a semicolon in the connection string: .connection\_string = "TrustServerCertificate=yes;"
 
I have started to get this issue where my personal PC at home is requiring permission to remote control. I hadn't changed any settings on the TeamViewer, but I may have updated the client, but I have never had to do this in the past and it is now making it near impossible for me to connect to my current logged on session.
 
I have double checked that unattended access is configured, which it is and I have double checked the client advanced settings is set to 'full access', which it is. I have also uninstalled the client with the remove settings option selected, then downloaded the newest stable release and reconfigured everything etc. But it still is requiring the logged on user to grant control. Is this a new "feature"? Any thoughts on what I can change to have complete unattended access even with a user, ie. me, logged on?
 
I am having this same problem all of a sudden after some Windows updates. I can no longer remotely access my other computers on my home network without TeamViewer wanting a partner confirmation from the remote computer! I've read and applied all the steps suggested in your paper on this subject, but I still have the same problem! Please help.
 
I am seeing a similar issue (Easy Access suddently doesn't work on the outgoing Windows 10, but it still works on another outgoing Windows 7), I am trying different options, furthermore, Windows 10 is under a major upgrade (2004) right now, I will update status later.
 
I also have this issue, with my tower, I do have remote access using my cell phone but more difficult to use. I often assist a visually impaired combat disabled Vietnam veteran who CANNOT USE THE MOUSE BECAUSE HE NO LONGER CAN SEE THE MOUSE. This change has made teamviewer nothing more than remote viewer, thus useless.
 
I too followed these steps to no avail. Please advise. We have been trying ti fix this for 2 hours, just today, and cannot correct it. Thisd is strictly for personal use. I only help disabled veterans WHO PAID IN FULL, WITH THEIR SERVICE AND SACRIFICE. NO MONEY IS PAID TO ME EVER!
 
OH running windows 10 pro 20H2, always worked in the past, today, worked via teamviewer for android, Worked with another windows 10 home PC, but this one, it does not do more then viewing remote PC. Jjust checked that remote PC for updates and is current . My tower is also current. Will mention, that my teamveiwer required updates but failed to update 3 times. I had to download and installed latest version.
 
I'm now having issues, everything was working perfectly until the guest pc had a windows update, now I have to allow remote control AND TeamViewer control. This is highly annoying as I use this to connect to a computer in a very inaccessible location.
 
Aside from the "not-so-helpful" guide by Community Manager above, I now understood that there is NEW settings introduced in TeamViewer that disallow us to connect despite Advanced Settings says Full Control. Recently I have found out that there are 2 similar settings, "Advanced Settings for connections to this computer" and "Advanced Settings for connections to other computers". I'm not sure when, but it's just recently introduced.
 
So, despite your remote computer "Advanced Settings for connections to this computer" is set to "Full Control", it does not mean you'll get full control. It depends on the source connecting computer, whether the setting is the same.
 
In your source connecting computer, the default for "Advanced Settings for connections to other computers" is "View and Show", which is why I was scratching my head about where does this issue come from.
 
Firstly, make sure both source and destination computer TV are updated to the latest one. Source computer "Advanced Settings for connections to other computers" set to "Full Control", and Remote (destination) computer "Advanced Settings for connections to this computer" must also set to "Full Control".
 
I am having this problem when connecting from a Mac to an unattended agent, when the agent is logged on, although it has "full access" (Vollzugriff), I get the "wait for user to share" or however it is translated, I still get access to the agent (lock screen, waiting for password), but after 80 seconds, the session automatically disconnects again (countdown in a window in the middle of the desktop on the agent. If the agent is logged off, I get straight on with no issues.
 
Further testing after running into the same problem after computer restart. I think the problem was actually resolved by running Docker Desktop as Administrator. I think there are some conflicting admin privileges that might be leading to problems? A lot of speculation but hoping this helps someone else.

**Students enrolled in online courses at Virginia Western are expected to have a laptop computer (or a desktop system with webcam and microphone) that meets the minimum specifications listed below and high-speed internet access at home or another readily accessible location. A list of recommended and preferred computer specifications for students can be found below.**
 
Students do not necessarily have to buy a brand-new system. Most new computers purchased in the last three years should meet the minimum specifications listed below for completing coursework. (If students are unsure if a device will be adequate, please contact the Virginia Western Help Desk for further assistance).
 
In addition to a windows-based computer, Microsoft Office 365 (VWCC free full online version located here) is required to complete these courses. Chromebooks and Apple MacBooks are not compatible with the software required in these courses.
 
Intel / AMD Processors are recommended. M1/ARM processors (M1 Macs, Surface Pro X) will work with most software, but are not guaranteed to run all software and may require additional software or support. Students are responsible for academic consequences of deviation from the requirement.
 
A Windows OS laptop/computer meeting the recommended computer specifications for students is required for all CAD courses. Usage of Apple products is not recommended, including a M1 MacBook, Surface Pro X with ARM processor, or Chromebooks, which do not meet CAD software requirements.
