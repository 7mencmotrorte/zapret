I have a whole list of possible topics for commentaries, but as I sorted through them, my thoughts kept returning to April Dowler. My wife and I, and about 200 other friends and relatives, attended a memorial service for her last Saturday at the Presbyterian church in Shepherdstown. April died earlier this month after a nearly five-year-long battle with cancer.
 
April accomplished much in her life. She was a lawyer, a family law master, a mediator, a teacher, a volunteer for many civic organizations and even a restaurant critic. She raised two children and had two grandchildren.
 
And she had lots of friends. She loved easily and was generous with her heart. When you were with April, she was always present. That accessible heart meant she could be hurt, but she would also forgive.
 
We talked often during her long illness and there was never any bitterness or hint that she felt sorry for herself. Every conversation would come back to her asking about us. How were we doing? What was going on in our lives?
 
She was whip smart, honest and opinionated, but never hateful or malicious. Her years as a family court judge contributed to her rational thinking about relationships. That quality meant friends frequently wanted her advice on issues great and small.
 
Her husband, John, was a tireless caregiver. She brought out the best in John and he said during the memorial that their relationship was stronger on the last day than it was on the first. He was holding her hand and telling her that he loved her as she breathed her last.
 
April crammed so much into those years, and still always found time to be a loving wife, mother, grandmother and friend. If you are lucky, you know someone like April, that rare individual who makes everyone around them better. There is a richness to their lives that is infectious.
 
The report shows the scale of the NYC Metro region life sciences economy with nearly 150,000 jobs and 5,100 businesses, generating over $23 billion in wages last year. The report further finds that the NYC Metro region has 14,000 more life sciences jobs than the next leading metro area, San Francisco, and 30 percent more life sciences businesses than Boston, which followed on the list.
 
From new jobs to new medicines to new medical devices to cutting edge therapies, a connected regional life sciences ecosystem can create more equitable opportunity and cutting-edge innovations that improve patient care and help those who are sick. Now, more than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of the life sciences industry has never been clearer from vaccine development to discovery of variants. This is why partnership between New York City, New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, and cities and counties across the NYC Metro will be critical for the region and country ahead.

**Years of Service**
I started my career with Metro Parks in August 2000, as an Interpretive Aide here at Slate Run Living Historical Farm. I was promoted to the position of Historical Farmer in March this year.
 
**What I do at Metro Parks**
As a living historical farm, our purpose is educational. We teach visitors and school groups about farming life in this area of Ohio in the 1880s. We teach by doing. And what we do, we do as it would have been done in the 19th century. As well as program development and teaching, I perform numerous farming tasks, such as blacksmithing, woodworking, broommaking, sheep shearing, farming the land, and restoring historic farming equipment. I had worked at Roscoe Village for five years before joining Metro Parks, so I had developed a good historic skills set there, which has been greatly developed in my time here.
 
**My favorite food and dessert**
A steak and cheese sandwich, with peppers and onions on a hoagie roll, is as good as it gets. For dessert, it could be anything with chocolate. Or an apple pie. I like to make my own apple pie.
 
Awesome park system. I have always loved coming to slate run farm, reminds me of my grandparents farm. Making crackers in the kitchen. Carring water petting the calf or chucking Tomatoes for the chickens to eat. Always great to bring scout groups. Thank you!!
