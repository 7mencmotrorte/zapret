Do you need to discover and identify the network devices attached to your switches?

Do you need a single app to map port usage on several different brands of switches?

Our Switch Port Mapper can discover and show you the MAC addresses and optionally IPv4 addresses of devices attached to the physical ports of your switches. Supply the SNMP access credentials for each switch and map them manually or as a list of switches.
 
I have a lab setup which will be eventually used on sites
I have one FortiGate which acts as the router and firewall and one managed switch hanging off this FortiGate with APs connected to it.
The legacy setup was a cisco switch and FortiGate where in the cisco switch acted a layer 2 switch for passing the wan connections to the FortiGate as well as the core switch providing connectivity to users.
It was a basic router on a stick configuration with the cisco switch hanging off the FortiGate and multiple wan interfaces used for SD/WAN connections and Lan interfaces for the users.
I am trying to replicate the same with the Forti switch but in a managed mode. I see the Forti VLANs are attached to the Forti link interface and the wan interfaces from the FortiGate are mapped to another interface(port1) on the FortiGate.
I configured the Forti switch with the same VLANs as the cisco switch and connected the FortiGate(port1) on the same ports the cisco switch, with an exclusive port (port4) just for the Forti link so that FortiGate can manage the Forti switch. 
But I have not been having any luck with this configuration. 
I need the wan interface from my provider equipment able to communicate with the FortiGate (port1) while connected on the Forti switch in a managed mode through Forti link on port4 . both of them have the same VLAN id 216(VLAN 216 on the the FortiGate interface port1 and Forti vlan 216 on Forti link interface port4) allowed through but there seems to be no communication
Any suggestions
 
If that is the case than I think you need to create those VLANs in the Fortilink interface and manage them through the SW controller. I don't think having two separate links to FSW will work well, it's better to build a LAG to have better throughput and use them as a single FLink for Router-on-a-stick functions.

Thank you, I shall try this. but we have a lot of WAN connections needed to be spanned across and corresponding SD WAN zones with tunnels across each WAN. it might get a bit complex to manage...
To keep it simple, we may keep a core switch doing only layer 2 for all the WAN connections and a trunk to the FG and then manage the downstream LANs via the FortiLANs/managed switch
 
I want to do this aswell I have two wan interfaces and two vdoms right now I want to add a wan side switch. How do I execute this? Am I exposing myself to risk cause of the allow access built into the switch? Do I plug the wan interfaces into the switch and keep my policies or do I just static the vlans and plocy them directly lan to vdomlinks? Cause when I first tried it with plugging my aggregate wan interfaces into my switch and having my policies go from wan to vdomlinks I was getting ip conflict warnings.. .. Also is having a wan side switch a good or bad idea on a ha configuration? I think if I plug my router into a random port on my switch and create my vlans and policy those to each vdom link and static route them I should be good?

Reading the DHCP specs, nothing obvious jumps out as supporting this, but (some?) Cisco switches offer a feature called "DHCP Server Port-Based Address Allocation" which achieves this; so can it be done by:
 
This is largely theoretical (I don't need to implement it), but I'm curious as to how "simple" it really is. Could I do it with my existing HP Procurve 2524 & dnsmasq, would I need a more sophisticated DHCP server, or would I need a new Cisco switch too?
 
DHCP option 82 is really what you are looking for, assuming you have a DHCP server that supports it. Once you have a DHCP request with the switch / port information in it, assigning an IP to it should be pretty trivial (just matching up the switch / port to what's in your database). Most production networks don't rely on DHCP though, because it's something else that can fail. This might be nice for the initial setup (have the machine pull an IP via DHCP, then configure itself to use that as a static IP), but I wouldn't suggest you try and run servers off of DHCP.

When selecting the right type of switch to meet your needs, one consideration is whether to use a managed or an unmanaged switch. The key difference is in the amount of control you have over the settings of the switch.
 
Unmanaged switches are designed to just plug in and run, with no settings to configure. These are fine to use in small networks with only basic needs. Managed switches, however, are fully configurable, are customizable, and provide a range of data on performance. Those attributes make them more suitable for larger networks and networks supporting critical activities.
 
Managed switches, with the flexibility and control they provide, are a must for networks where reliability and security are critical. Typically, such networks power enterprise-level businesses, government agencies, universities, and healthcare organizations.
 
A third type of switches, called smart managed switches, offers a compromise between cost and features. These switches are suited for small businesses that have limited budgets but need better security protection and want to improve their networks' performance.
