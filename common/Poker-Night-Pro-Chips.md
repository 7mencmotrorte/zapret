So I haphazardly pulled together a poker game at my house. I had an old poker table that I acquired from the previous owner of my home, and I had just got some chips from a friend as well. So I was all set on that front. What more could I need, right?
 
With a recent poker night, only three of the eight guys I invited could make it. I was strongly tempted to just change the date last minute and move it back a week. But, I held to the original plan, and simply invited some different guys from a wider circle of friends and acquaintances, and I encouraged the regulars who were coming to invite some new blood as well. It ended up being a great evening, and we had plenty of guys to make it worthwhile.

The Poker Knights poker chips are clay poker chips that have a 3 color chip mold and features imprints of a sword striking through a spade around the chip face. The inlay is compressed onto the chip and laminated with a thin layer of vinyl. (same as a real casino poker chip). The Poker Knights poker chips are available in 12 colors and may be purchased in bundles of 25 chips.
 
This is the distribution method that everyone is more accustomed to. But of course, you can change it slightly according to your own game type and level. Next, I will explain how to optimize your family bureau to the greatest extent and surprise everyone with your professionalism.
 
If it is a regular game, it is relatively simple to set up the buy-in. The face value of the chips often matches with the same amount of money. Additionally, there is no need to specially design the prize pool. This is also the most common form of game among poker enthusiasts, because there is no need to worry about a tournament timer or raising blinds.
 
A standard chip set usually contains about 300 chips, which come with 4 color variations: 100 pieces for white, 50 pieces for each of the other colors. This type of set is basically enough for 5-6 players to play comfortably.
 
In this type of game, players can bring in as much as they want. But usually the host needs to specify a minimum and maximum amount of buy-in. The common set-up is 20bb for the minimum and 100bb for the maximum.
 
One of the benefits of playing home tournaments is that everyone will lose at most one ticket. It is not as easy to lose control as a regular poker game, but it can still bring tension to the table. The winner can also receive relatively generous rewards.

In home tournaments, each player needs fewer chips, but the value of each chip is higher. Even so, the most common set of 300 chips is sufficient for a small group of 6 players. However, if you have up to 9 participants, then you will need at least a 500-chip set.
 
This situation can very easily turn chaotic. On the other hand, frequent changes in the face value of the chips will greatly affect your game experience. Our recommendation is to add on more color to your table.
 
Tips: If you want to play a deep stacked game but don't have too many chips on hand, just use the standard $3000 starting chips distribution, and control the game time for each level to be a little longer. The general rhythm is 15-20 minutes for each level. In this situation, you can extend it to 30-45 minutes each.
 
For most home games, each blind level should not exceed 20 minutes. 15 minutes is the most reasonable length. According to this time setting, even if there is only one table, the entire tournament could run for several hours.
 
For friendly and happy home tournaments, I suggest spreading out the wealth as it is shown below. In this way, 1/3 of the participants can receive some rewards. Here is how you can set up the prize pool:
 
Short stack generally means that in a poker game, the total number of chips held by a player is fewer than 40 big blinds. When a player holds 50-100 big blinds, we generally think that he is a mid-stack player. When a player holds more than 100 big blinds, he is a deep stack player.
 
Hi there, can you answer me a question. If you start a game of texas holdem with 7 players and there are 4 knocked out due to no chips left. With the 3 that is left and all 3 goes all in an one person wins all the chips from the other 2 players does that person win all the money in the pot.
 
SLOWPLAY is a professional Texas Hold'em equipment brand founded by several committed players who love Texas Hold'em. We wanted to create the ultimate poker chips, playing cards, and more, allowing players to invest more and enjoy every process in poker.
 
So long as there is little pressure, most men will come around. A big tip is to invite gentlemen from various circles, so there is a wide range of personalities. This gives the other men a chance to meet a new friend perhaps, or gain a business contact.
 
This is pretty standard for any party that serves alcohol, but when you mix gambling, hard earned money, mixed personalities and alcohol together, you need to be especially careful that the evening goes without a hitch.
 
Because of this, we recommend sending out an actual invitation by mail. The invitation should specify what the night is all about, what game will be played and the basics that everyone needs to know, such as:
 
If you do decide to state an end-time for the game, do so ahead of time and specify when the game will end in the invitation. Then, when you go over the rules, explain how the winner will be determined and how you will deal with any risk of a tied game. Will there be a sudden death hand dealt, will the pot be split, etc.? The goal is clarity and ensuring that every player leaves without resentment because the feel swindled or was unsure of the rules.
 
The room that the game is played in usually has no entertainment. At the most, I might have some music playing as the players begin to arrive, but it is always turned off once the game begins. Here are some music suggestions:
 
For lower budget games, consider snacks like chips, nuts, party mix, popcorn, pretzels and other inexpensive items that can easily be consumed with one hand while playing. Of course, regardless of your budget, these are great items to keep on hand anyhow.
 
A selection of beers is best, but you can always just offer one kind. A good selection will consist of light and dark domestics and imports. You could also offer a selection of craft beer or flavoured beer if you really want to have a variety. Here are some basic brands to consider:
 
The story behind Orphan Barrel is about as intriguing as it gets. Diageo basically finds long-forgotten barrels of rare whiskey discovered in old rickhouses and distilleries around the United States and bottles them for sale under the new brand Orphan Barrel. All are limited but some are very rare, and each one comes with a compelling story.
 
One of the most storied and rare bourbons in the world, Pappy Van Winkle is a whiskey that every man knows, but few will ever try. If you can get your hands on a bottle, consider pulling it out and talking about the history of the brand and whether it lives up to its reputation.
 
Any rare or vintage Scotch is always a talking point. If you have the funds or a bottle in the bar, consider pulling it out. After all, a gathering of friends is the best time to open a bottle of Scotch.
 
Vodka is a little simpler than whisky. Sure, there are purists out there, but at a party, most men are content with one or two bottles that can be used in a martini or simply consumed over ice. For that, we recommend Grey Goose or Ketel One as both are considered high-quality vodkas but sell for reasonable prices.
 
There are many other spirits worth having on hand. The goal of a poker night is to enjoy the game, not get drunk. Plus, at some point, the hope is everyone can get home without having to sleep in your guest room or leave their car. Some spirits like tequila have a tendency to get misused by some guests, and if you open the game up to a wide array of people or friends of friends, you increase the risk that someone will have too much to drink.
 
If you plan to have multiple tables for a tournament or larger crowd, or you have limited space, this octagon table is a great option instead of the larger rectangular tables. Click here to buy one today.
 
Playing cards are a must and at a minimum, you should have two sealed decks for each table. The more, the merrier. Of course a factory sealed deck is best for games with strangers but with friends you can use an existing deck especially if you use quality plastic cards. Click here to get a Copag Jumbo Size plastic card deck.
 
If you have a beer you plan to feature, why not invest in a mini keg dispenser. Not only are these neat to use, but they pour the beer at the perfect temperature every time, and you can pour a little or pour a lot. Click here to buy one.
 
If you do plan to permit smoking in the house, consider investing in an air purifier that will rid the room of smoke and smell. There are many on the market, but this one is under $100 and has great reviews. Click here to buy it.
 
An ashtray is a must when smoking a cigar, but the typical cigarette ashtray is almost useless for cigars. Instead, for $10, invest in this cigar ashtray that you can rest up to four cigars in as you smoke. Click here to get it.
 
It's cliche -- as the lady of the house, I get to cook a whole meal for the poker night crew of dudes and then not get to eat it. It has to be the standard fare -- chili, pork bbq, pizza, etc. Nothing interesting. And it's a Friday during lent and that matters to this crowd (I got in trouble last year for white chicken chili). Ideas? I'm at a loss this time and am having a hard time getting inspired. And yes, I could just have them order pizza, but as someone who loves to cook, I really don't like to do that. Help picklers!
