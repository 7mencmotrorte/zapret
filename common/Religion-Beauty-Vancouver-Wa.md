The resurrection of the body is one of the foundational statements of Christian theology, but what will the resurrection be like? Paul tell us we will be glorified but does not go into specifics about what glorified actually means. As a result, most theological discussions of what the resurrection will be like are grounded in assumptions about the kinds of earthly bodies that are more desirable. From the beginning of Christian history up until the present day, definitions of beauty and the perceived undesirability of female, disabled, and non-caucasian bodies has affected both how the Bible is read and how heavenly bodies are imagined.

Recognizing the diverse faith backgrounds of the school community and the world, the chapel program operates in keeping with the Episcopal Christian tradition of inclusiveness, and all of the major world religions are honored in our services. All students, regardless of their religious backgrounds or beliefs, are welcome and important to the community experience of our chapel program. Students who wish to attend services off campus in their own religious traditions are allowed and encouraged to do so if a local option is available.
 
Considered a landmark of English Gothic Revival architecture, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the chapel was designed by Ralph Adams Cram, and includes the work of famed artisans and sculptors. Beyond the beauty of its spaces, there are many beloved school traditions connected to the chapel. For more than a century, the school has gathered in December to celebrate at the Christmas Festival and since the consecration of the chapel, the head of school has traditionally recited the School Prayer at each chapel service.
 
Almighty God, the Fountain of all Wisdom, without Whom nothing is strong, nothing is holy, we beseech Thee to bless the members of this school with Thy perpetual presence and prosper them in their work. Keep their hearts free from sin. May they be truthful and reverent in their speech, earnest and faithful in their studies, kind and considerate in their dealings with each other and always ready to help the unprotected and helpless. Bless, we beseech Thee, the teachers of this school and impress upon them a due sense of the responsibilities of their charge. We pray that from these walls students may go forth, generation after generation, well equipped for the battle of life and ready to contend bravely for God and the truth. And this we ask in the name of Him who died for our salvation, to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
