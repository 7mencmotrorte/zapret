If you use server-side characters, we recommend enabling login before join. We discovered a bug that existed in the 5.0.0 release just before this release. If a player is disabled by TShock before they login, a situation can occur where all SSC data is erased. We suggest alerting your users to this fact and telling them not to login if they're disabled. If they do this, they may lose all character data in the database. Alternatively, enable login before join.
 
TShock version mastering occurs as the last step in the release process. When we cut a new version, we expect to release that version and all changes made prior to the version being cut. Unfortunately, a late-breaking bug with new internationalization changes between 5.0.0 and 5.1.0 was discovered after 5.1.0 was mastered. Therefore, we opted to tick the version again after fixing the bug, and we mastered this release instead. No download for 5.1.0 will be made available, nor will a release.

This version of TShock for Terraria adds updated and improved handling of SendTileRectangle packets. The previous approach acted on a "denylist" basis. That is to say, it attempted to parse out which actions were invalid, and denied based on patterns that matched that. Based on a cheating client that was recently released, @punchready implemented an alternative system, based on an allowlist approach. This approach, in contrast to the prior approach, only permits SendTileRectangle placements that specifically exist in the game, based on hand-analysis of the game logic. If you encounter any normal gameplay situations that render these fixes problematic, please send us a report. This should dramatically increase serverside security and prevent a host of exploits affecting TShock. Also included in this patch is a fix for an exploit that allowed users to place ice tiles in protected regions. This was revealed by a cheat developer to be a method for griefing some public servers with spawn protection.
 
In the latest State of the Game blog, developer Re-Logic billed a recently added Steam beta branch as the "first final update." If you have Terraria installed on Steam, you can hop into the game properties, go to the betas page, and opt in to v1.1.2. That'll take you back to a version of Terraria where, as the devs put it, "Hardmode was brand new and the mech bosses represented the ultimate challenge."
 
There might actually be more final updates than that, too. Last year, the devs told our friends at PC Gamer that 2015's 1.3 update was the first one intended to be final, and there have been a lot of Terraria patches since then that Re-Logic may have meant to serve as a send-off.

Version 1.1.2 here was never intended to be a final update, with the moniker serving as an acknowledgement of that long-running meme. It also seems to be part of a series. As a very serious April Fools' joke, Re-Logic released Terraria: Undeluxe Edition back on April 1, offering another beta branch with version 1.0.6.1. That's a version just late enough to include all the essential bug fixes, but still early enough to capture the early Terraria experience. Here's hoping other snapshots of Terraria's other biggest moments in time will follow.

To get started, you can customize your character's look by choosing either male or female, then choosing the color of your hair, eyes, skin, and clothing. Then, you simply give your character a name and then name the world that will be created.
 
**Playing the game**
 Early on, your character is fairly weak and once night falls, zombies and other baddies will be on the hunt. That's why it's important to start chopping down trees right away to build a shelter before nightfall. Later, you'll also want to build housing for NPCs that arrive as you pass certain milestones. But rather than giving you a step-by-step guide for the early parts of this extremely involved game, the best resource for learning how to play Terraria is at the Terraria Wiki. Generally, the key is to explore and mine blocks in order to craft items that will make your character stronger so you can take on the game's five difficult bosses.
 
As you explore and find minerals and other items, you'll be able to craft more than 200 different things, from tools and weapons your character can use to chandeliers and bookcases for decorating your home base. Check out the crafting recipe page at Terraria Wiki to see the types of things you can make. If you haven't guessed already, this is a game with a immense amount of depth (pun intended), so if you were looking for a simple casual distraction, this is not the game for you.
 
**The controls are not perfect**
 The touch-screen controls are functional, but not ideal. To move your character, there's a control pad in the lower left of the screen. Any item you use, whether it's a sword or a blaster or a stick of dynamite, is activated by touching the right side of the screen. Where in the PC version of the game you mine by pointing your mouse cursor at a block and clicking, with the iOS version you just touch the block with your finger. This opens up a small zoom window so you can see exactly which block you're mining. On the iPad, this control setup works fairly well, but it still can't compare to a keyboard and a mouse or a game controller. But when it comes to the smaller screen of the iPhone or iPod Touch, it's much more frustrating.
 
The difference between the two devices is more than just a difference in screen size. With the smaller screen, you actually can't see as much of your surroundings at one time as you can on the iPad. But to make it even more frustrating, the small zoom window will actually sometimes appear halfway off the screen so you can't see which block you're mining. Hopefully, a fix will come in the next update that smartly pushes the zoom window below your finger when it's getting close to the top of the screen, but iPhone and iPod users should beware of this limitation before buying.
