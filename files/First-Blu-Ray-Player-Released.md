Since the genre's inception, advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have proven fundamental to allow a reasonable level of immersion in the game world, and this type of game helped pushing technology progressively further, challenging hardware developers worldwide to introduce numerous innovations in the field of graphics processing units. Multiplayer gaming has been an integral part of the experience, and became even more prominent with the diffusion of internet connectivity in recent years.

The first-person shooter genre has been traced back to *Wolfenstein 3D* (1992) which has been credited with creating the basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based. One such title, considered the progenitor of the genre's mainstream acceptance and popularity, was *Doom* (1993), often cited as the most influential game in this category; for years, the term "Doom clone" was used to designate this type of game, due to *Doom*'s enormous success.[2] Another common name for the genre in its early days was "corridor shooter", since processing limitations of that era's computer hardware meant that most of the action had to take place in enclosed areas, such as corridors and small rooms.[3]
 
During the 1990s, the genre has been one of the main cornerstones for technological advancements of computer graphics, starting with the release of *Quake* in 1996. *Quake* was one of the first real-time 3D rendered video games in history, and quickly became one of the most acclaimed shooter games of all time.[4][5] Graphics accelerator hardware became essential to improve performances and add new effects such as full texture mapping, dynamic lighting and particle processing to the 3D engines that powered the games of that period, such as the iconic id Tech 2, the first iteration of the Unreal Engine, or the more versatile Build. Other seminal games were released during the years, with *Marathon* enhancing the narrative and puzzle elements,[6][7][8] *Duke Nukem 3D* introducing voice acting, complete interactivity with the environment, and city-life settings to the genre, and games like *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six* and *Counter-Strike* starting to adopt a realistic and tactical approach aimed at simulating real life counter-terrorism situations. *GoldenEye 007*, released in 1997, was a landmark first-person shooter for home consoles, while the critical and commercial success of later titles like *Perfect Dark*, *Medal of Honor* and the *Halo* series helped to heighten the appeal of this genre for the consoles market, straightening the road to the current tendency to release most titles as cross-platform, like many games in the *Far Cry* and *Call of Duty* series.

First-person shooters are a type of shooter game[9] that relies on a first-person point of view with which the player experiences the action through the eyes of the character. They differ from third-person shooters in that, in a third-person shooter, the player can see the character they are controlling (usually from behind, or above). The primary design focus is combat, mainly involving firearms or other types of long range weapons.[10]
 
A defining feature of the genre is "player-guided navigation through a three-dimensional space." This is a defining characteristic that clearly distinguishes the genre from other types of shooting games that employ a first-person perspective, including light gun shooters, rail shooters, shooting gallery games, or older shooting electro-mechanical games.[1] First person-shooter games are thus categorized as being distinct from light gun shooters, a similar genre with a first-person perspective which uses dedicated light gun peripherals, in contrast to the use of conventional input devices.[11] Light-gun shooters (like *Virtua Cop*) often feature "on-rails" (scripted) movement, whereas first-person shooters give the player complete freedom to roam the surroundings.
 
The first-person shooter may be considered a distinct genre itself, or a type of shooter game, in turn a subgenre of the wider action game genre.[12] Following the release of *Doom* in 1993, games in this style were commonly referred to as "**Doom clones**";[13][14] over time this term has largely been replaced by "first-person shooter".[14] *Wolfenstein 3D,* released in 1992, the year before *Doom*, has been often credited with introducing the genre, but critics have since identified similar, though less advanced, games developed as far back as 1973.[10] There are occasional disagreements regarding the specific design elements which constitute a first-person shooter. For example, titles like *Deus Ex* or *BioShock* may be considered as first-person shooters, but may also fit into the role-playing games category, as they borrow extensively from that genre.[15] Other examples, like *Far Cry* and *Rage*, could also be considered adventure games, because they focus more on exploration than simple action, they task players with multiple different objectives other than just killing enemies, and they often revolve around the construction of complex cinematic storylines with a well defined cast of secondary characters to interact with. Furthermore, certain puzzle or platforming games are also sometimes categorized as first-person shooters, in spite of lacking any direct combat or shooting element, instead using a first-person perspective to help players immerse within the game and better navigate 3D environments (for example, in the case of *Portal*, the 'gun' the player character carries is used to create portals through walls rather than fire projectiles).[16] Some commentators also extend the definition to include combat flight simulators and space battle games, whenever the cockpit of the aircraft is depicted from a first-person point of view.[7][10]
 
Like most shooter games, first-person shooters involve an avatar, one or more ranged weapons, and a varying number of enemies.[12] Because they take place in a 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions.[9] First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games,[17][18] which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming.[19] It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a heads-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.[20]
 
First-person shooters generally focus on action gameplay, with fast-paced combat and dynamic firefights being a central point of the experience, though certain titles may also place a greater emphasis on narrative, problem-solving and logic puzzles.[21] In addition to shooting, melee combat may also be used extensively. In some games, melee weapons are especially powerful, as a reward for the risk the player must take in maneuvering his character into close proximity to the enemy.[22] In other games, instead, melee weapons may be less effective but necessary as a last resort.[23] "Tactical shooters" tend to be more realistic, and require the players to use teamwork and strategy in order to succeed;[19] the players can often command a squad of characters, which may be controlled by the A.I. or by human teammates,[24] and can be given different tasks during the course of the mission.
 
First-person shooters typically present players with a vast arsenal of weapons, which can have a large impact on how they will approach the game.[9] Some games offer realistic reproductions of actual existing (or even historical) firearms, simulating their rate of fire, magazine size, ammunition amount, recoil and accuracy. Depending on the context, other first-person shooters may incorporate some imaginative variations, including futuristic prototypes, alien-technology or magical weapons, and/or implementing a wide array of different projectiles, from lasers, to energy, plasma, rockets, and arrows. These many variations may also be applied to the tossing of grenades, bombs, spears and the like. Also, more unconventional modes of destruction may be employed by the playable character, such as flames, electricity, telekinesis or other supernatural powers, and traps.
 
In the early era of first-person shooters, often designers allowed characters to carry a large number of different weapons with little to no reduction in speed or mobility. More modern games started to adopt a more realistic approach, where the player can only equip a handheld gun, coupled with a rifle, or even limiting the players to only one weapon of choice at a time, forcing them to swap between different alternatives according to the situation. In some games, there's the option to trade up or upgrade weapons, resulting in multiple degrees of customization. Thus, the standards of realism are extremely variable.[9] The protagonist can generally get healing and equipment supplies by means of collectible items such as first aid kits or ammunition packs, simply by walking over, or interacting with them.[25] Some games allow players to accumulate experience points in a role-playing game fashion, that can generally be used to unlock new weapons, bonuses and skills.[26]
