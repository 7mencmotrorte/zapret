Hosts typically do not include intermediary network devices like switches and routers, which are instead often categorized as nodes. A node is a broader term that includes anything connected to a network, while a host requires an IP address. In other words, all hosts are nodes, but network nodes are not hosts unless they require an IP address to function.
 
Hosts use various protocols to communicate, including TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). On a TCP/IP network, each host has a host number that, together with a network identity, forms its unique IP address. In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, protocols in the transport layer, also known as Layer 4, are responsible for communication between hosts.
 
For companies or individuals with a website, a host is a web server that stores and transmits the data for one or more websites. Host can also refer to the service provider that leases this infrastructure, which is known as hosting.

A cloud host is based on cloud computing technologies that enable a number of servers to act as one system in which website performance can be guaranteed by multiple machines. It often includes a network of servers pulling from different data centers in different locations.
 
Cloud hosts operate as a service that enables clients to buy as much of the service as they need. Cloud hosting is an alternative to hosting a website on a single server. Cloud hosting can be considered both infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). Using a public cloud model, a public network transmits data that is physically stored on shared virtual servers that make up the cloud resource.
 
The term virtual host has two uses. One refers to the technology used to run multiple domains or applications on a single physical server. The second refers to companies that sell virtual infrastructure services.
 
In this context, users access a remote host in a different physical location using a private network or the internet. This process provides users with remote access. Examples include servers that users can log in to remotely or a host computer for a remote desktop.
 
In this context, a mainframe computer can be the host provider of services for the workstations attached to it. This does not mean that the host only has servers and the workstations only have clients. The server-client relationship is a programming model independent of this contextual usage of the term host.
 
A hostname is a plaintext name identifying a host in a given domain. On a local area network (LAN), a server's hostname might be a nickname like mailserver1. On the internet, a hostname makes up part of a web address and has three parts:
 
Hi @RICHF1 welcome to the GoTo Community. You can change which computer is set up as host any time you want, so to keep inline with your 2 licensees you can delete bluebox and set up another and when finished, set it back up.
 
I have gone through this and removed a pc, added another, worked on that computer then deleted it. Sent a link to add another and it shows up in the client tab, however when I go to access it with user name and password it doesn't recognise it and pretty confident I have added the correct info. The user name has been changed some time ago to reflect change of staff and this has been used but wondered if this could have anything to do with it?
 
@RICHF1 from what you are describing, it sounds like a username/password isn't recognized and you should double-check that. An older username shouldn't be causing issues if this is the first time setting up.
 
With no host monitors there is only a blank screen at the client computer. None of our LogMeIn installs have a mirror driver installed. What needs to change to allow people to see two displays remotely?
 
Ok, got some information on this from LogMeIn support. If you want to run the workstation to be accessed with no monitors, but want dual (or more) monitor support remotely, then you can use Headless Monitor Emulators plugged in where your 2nd (or more) monitors would be plugged-in. I haven't tried yet, but I did order the emaulators on amazon. You can get 3-packs for under $20 depending on port type.
 
I spent some time on hold with LogMeIn and found out the answer is no. You must have at least one monitor at the host. If you want to see two monitors at the client side, you'll need two monitors at the host.
 
Thank you! I saw something about "headless" in a 2013 post then nothing else so I thought it was dead technology. Your complete name for the device makes it a whole lot easier to locate them. Thank you so much!
 
H, yes the emulators worked. We used two brands from Amazon, one was FUERAN and the other brand was FREEGENE. I think any will work. Also, if you are emulating only two monitors, then you really just need one emulator on the host computer to emulate the second monitor (one monitor doesn't need an emulator) however, we did find that the resolutions were easier to match up if two emulators were used.
 
Follow the instruction shown there, it will let you install up to 4 virtual screens, I just tested them and they work with LMI once the real monitors have been disconnected from the host PC.

You're welcome!
 
A **network host** is a computer or other device connected to a computer network. A host may work as a server offering information resources, services, and applications to users or other hosts on the network. Hosts are assigned at least one network address.
 
A computer participating in networks that use the Internet protocol suite may also be called an **IP host**. Specifically, computers participating in the Internet are called **Internet hosts**. Internet hosts and other IP hosts have one or more IP addresses assigned to their network interfaces. The addresses are configured either manually by an administrator, automatically at startup by means of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), or by stateless address autoconfiguration methods.
 
In operating systems, the term *terminal host* denotes a time-sharing computer or multi-user software providing services to computer terminals, or a computer that provides services to smaller or less capable devices,[1] such as a mainframe computer serving teletype terminals or video terminals. Other examples of this architecture include a telnet host connected to a telnet server and an xhost connected to an X Window client.
 
The term *Internet host* or just *host* is used in a number of Request for Comments (RFC) documents that define the Internet and its predecessor, the ARPANET. RFC 871 defines a host as a general-purpose computer system connected to a communications network for "... the purpose of achieving resource sharing amongst the participating operating systems..."[2]
 
While the ARPANET was being developed, computers connected to the network were typically mainframe computer systems that could be accessed from dumb terminals connected via serial ports. Since these terminals did not host software or perform computations themselves, they were not considered *hosts* as they were not connected to any IP network, and were not assigned IP addresses. User computers connected to the ARPANET at a packet-switching node were considered hosts.[3]
 
A network node is any device participating in a network. A host is a node that participates in user applications, either as a server, client, or both. A server is a type of host that offers resources to the other hosts. Typically a server accepts connections from clients who request a service function.[4]
 
Every network host is a node, but not every network node is a host. Network infrastructure hardware, such as modems, Ethernet hubs, and network switches are not directly or actively participating in application-level functions, and do not necessarily have a network address, and are not considered to be network hosts.
 
**Web hosting is a service that allows people and computers to make their websites accessible via the internet. A web host provides the services and infrastructure that a site needs to operate on the World Wide Web.**
 
**The only person in control of the server when you host your website is you**. You can modify things to make your site better, you can adjust the settings however you want, and you have complete control over your site. Solid hosting providers like Verpex give their customers full control of decision-making and support and help you through the process.
 
WordPress hosting is hosting that has been optimized to run WordPress. Usually, WordPress hosting offers support staff that has experience dealing with technical issues related to WordPress, unlike the standard hosting staff that other hosting providers offer. WordPress hosting comes with better security, faster speeds, and server-side caching.
 
Cloud hosting is a network and server infrastructure that uses software to divide one physical server into several virtual servers. These devices are called VMs, or virtual machines. These servers can be used for remote-accessible desktop work environments, application development, web hosting, and much more. IT uses and pays only for the resources they need, so it can scale more efficiently.
