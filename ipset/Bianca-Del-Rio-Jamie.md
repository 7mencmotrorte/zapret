Here you can get big slabs of pizza just about anywhere; most typically pizza bianca or pizza rosso, which directly translates as white pizza or red pizza. Pizza bianca is similar to an unleavened focaccia, made with unhealthy amounts of olive oil and salt, with a crisp crust and airy texture. Pizza rosso is the same but with a thick, sweet tomato sauce baked on top. You can eat them just as they are or fold them over and stuff them with meat or cheese. One of my earliest memories is having picnics at the lake or in the Abruzzi hills with big slabs of pizza, buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto cotto and amazing ripe tomatoes.
 
Once my taste buds started to mature a little, I began to enjoy all the other toppings Italy had to offer. The crisp slabs of pizza we would always top with my now much-loved buffalo mozzarella and Parma ham, but I also started adding earthy Porcini mushrooms, delicate courgette flowers, salty capers and anchovies, and even thin slices of potato with rosemary. We also ate many of the classic wood-fired pizzas with an ultra-thin crispy base and an array of toppings. All were delicious and I could never decide which one to choose.
