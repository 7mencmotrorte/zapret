I had the same experience trying to install Photoshop Elements 9 on my new Windows 11 system. In my case, upon completing the install, I received two error messages stating that "A driver cannot load on this device".

I had the same experience trying to install Photoshop Elements 9 on my new Windows 11 system. In my case, upon completing the install, I received two error messages stating that "A driver cannot load on this device". I ignored the messages and tried restarting my system but it hung while trying to start Windows. The solution in my case was to reboot while holding down the key; I entered troubleshooting mode and then chose the option to boot to the command line. Using DOS commands I renamed three files containing the problematic drivers in order to hide them:
 
Photoshop Elements 9 seemed to open fine but at that point I decided I didn't want to discover other incompatibilities later so I uninstalled Elements 9 and upgraded to Elements 2023 which has a more usable appearance on a 4k monitor anyway.
 
I have had no luck hiding the photoshop files that keep windows 11 from loading using the command prompt. Could you tell me where in explorer you found those files? I browsed the Adobe files and didn't spot them. Thank you so much.
 
Thank you, Larry. I read your post over a few times and then, before taking the next step, I checked to see if File Explorer could find the files you mentioned. Not finding them, and being aware of your suggestion, I went ahead to shut down and rebooted. To my extreme pleasure, it booted up without the troubleshooting mode. No more old software for me!
 
Thanks a million, this saved us a lot of reinstalling etc. We had the exact same problem after installing Photoshop Elements 9 on Windows11. 'Hiding' the mentioned Sonic files made the laptop boot again.
 
Even after hiding those files the computer started doing some quirky things. E.g., I wanted to see if my CD writer would work as before, and it now took forever to copy a disk. Also, it seemed that at certain sleep settings (like 20 minutes) the computer would not shut down, though it would do so when I set it at 5 minutes. I had not had these problems prior to installing Photoshop Elements 10.

Installing Photoshop Elements 11 (licensed version) on my Windows 11 PC, I have encountered this problem as well, but I'm not sure that the installation is complete to the point where
I won't be able to reboot. I stopped at the error messages "This app can't run on this device" " PX Engine unknown". and a suggestion that I might try turning off Memory Integrity. Is there any chance that the installation has stopped and I could eliminate the problem by making some changes before I shut down and reboot? Reinstallation of my system would be a major problem for me.
Thanks in advance for your help.
 
Further to my message on Dec. 31, 2023 ... it's Photoshop Elements**13** I'm trying to install. Also, I have not found any evidence of the px... files mentioned in this thread. What advice would you give me at this point. I still have not tried any re-boots.
 
I am having trouble running my **Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0** on my new laptop. When I purchased Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 I was running it on Windows Vista Home Premium, but have since upgraded to **Windows 10**. I installed Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 on my new laptop and have had nothing but trouble. I was at first able to run the program and access my Catalogue through running the Trouble Shooter and selecting Windows Vista Service Pack 2 (or 3). However, since yesterday I can no longer access my program. If I try to open the Edit and Enhance Photos feature, the program freezes up on launch (where it says reading preferences) and does not open. If I try to open View and Organize Photos, the program also freezes and says that it failed to launch the Catalogue. Several people told me to uninstall the Adobe program from my computer and re-install it. However, after having done so I am still having the same problems. Can you provide me with more assistance? At this time I have uninstalled Adobe from my computer again and am waiting to do a fresh install with some guidance.
 
I was hoping there might be a work-around to getting the program to work. Strangely, my friend is able to run theirs on Windows 10 without problems. Do you happen to know if I would be able to open my 5.0 projects on the newest version of Adobe Photoshop? I want to be able to access and work on my old projects and hopefully get my Catalogue back. How would I go about doing this?

Open Notepad, paste the code, save as "PSLaunch.bat" instead of a ".txt", and if you want to make life extra easy, redirect your photoshop shortcut to the file. Please note, that this assumes you used the default install directory, if you installed it elsewhere, you will need to change the directory.
 
This code deletes the preferences file which seems to be the issue on Win 10 (and unfortuanately where all the settings are saved, so every launch the settings will be reset) and allows it to properly launch on Windows 10. Kind of a crappy work around but it works every time as of Win 10 20H2
 
I've run it on Windows 10 since Win10 was released, and for the first few years it gave me no issues. However, on more recent updates (19XX/20XX builds), even with a fresh install of windows, it will randomly either work or get hung during launch. The bat file just helps to garentee that PSE5 launches consistantly.
 
I had the same problem. No matter what I did and what I updated, still nope. No can do. Fresh Win10 (21H1) installation and everything was up to date and still this error.
Then I downloaded Creative Cloud, searched for Photoshop in the app and hit Try (knowing I would not buy another PS for awhile). I let it download for few minutes, then cancelled thinking this can't be the solution and was ready to give up. For unknown reason I still tried to install Elements. Just once more, and now it sudde
 
I've got the EXACT same error but with Adobe Premiere Elements 2019. It's got the LATEST Windows Update, I tried changing the browser to Internet Explorer 11 as default. I even ran Registry entries in the "Learn More" link in the error...still says my browser or operating system is out of date. I unchecked BOTH boxes in Compatibility Mode in Internet Explorer 11, still can't install. HELP.

Just once more, and now it suddenly worked just fine! 
So, I can't tell what exactly was the actual magic here but I thought it would be cool to share so you can try this out aswell. Hope it works for you, too!
 
Hi there, I'm currently having this issue. Could you provide a link for where you found the 'Creative\_Cloud\_Set-Up.exe' download please? Want to make sure I'm getting the correct download.
Many thanks!
 
Ok, I tried something slightly different. I first installed a newer version of Adobe elements photoshop (2021). Obviously couldn't activate it with my activation code, than installed 2019 just fine. I'm actually dissapointed that Adobe hasn't fixed this issue yet.
 
This worked for me as well. After Adobe Creative Cloud installed and I was logged into that. I then just re-ran the previoiusly downloaded Adobe Premier Elements 2019 installer exe and then it worked (not running into the o/s or browser needs update message).
 
Now I was able to install Premier Elements 2019 by triggering the installation via command prompt. But when trying to access the software it requires me to log-in, which is giving the same error as before 'Update required'... Eventhough I am already logged in on Creative Cloud app and the adobe website (fwiw).
 
Each time I get the same error at roughly the same point 2-3%. As a last resort I have even installed a fresh version of Windows 11 and done all of the updates etc. Device manager is happy with all devices. Still no joy.
 
Hi Ranjisha. I have recently fixed the problem by trashing windows again and loading elements before anything else. I believe that the issue was to do with microsoft runtimes (C++ ) etc. I have successfully installed all my other software and all are working as they should. The reason I did this process is because I also use CorelDraw (because I prefer it for vector) and had the same issue with it if I had Elements installed.
