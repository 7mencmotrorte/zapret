Throughout the program, we will look at the qualities and characteristics of a Teacher of Presence across several levels, the stumbling blocks we may encounter, and how the expressions of teaching Presence are as varied and unprecedented as the moments in which they unfold.

As Eckhart explains, it has never been more important than right now for people to fully commit to being Teachers of Presence. It is what our world needs. That is why he has created this new offering of The School of Awakening, turning his attention to helping us rise during this critical time in human history.
 
When you shift more continuously to a new way of Being, the way in which you move through your day, approach situations, work, and relate to those around you is imbued with so much Presence that your life becomes a teaching for others. This is what it means to be a Teacher of Presence. And this is how we live our highest purpose and change the world for the better.

Over the years, Eckhart has watched his community blossom into a movement of students from all over the world committed to the practice of Presence and awakening. More and more people in the world are ready and want to go deeper.
 
Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive. I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.
 
She is also the creator of the instructional Presence Through Movement videos *Qi Flow Yoga* and *Yin Yoga* and the guided audio programs *Meditations for a New Earth* and *Resist Nothing*, featuring practices for addressing inner challenges to living a life of Presence.
 
Students will be able to submit questions to Eckhart throughout the duration of the program. During the Live Q&A session, Eckhart will answer the questions that are most alive for *The School of Awakening*community.
 
In addition to online retreats, *The School of Awakening* offers the opportunity to connect and engage with your fellow classmates in a private social group (not Facebook), where you can share your experiences and ask questions in the safety of an understanding and supportive community.
 
Our highest intelligence and ability to be effective as Teachers of Presence lies in our openness to whatever is arising in the present moment and our comfort with the unknown, not in teaching from the known.
 
Many teachers seem to become hijacked by some form of ego inflation. What are the more subtle signs of ego inflation in teachers? How can we be sure to avoid ego inflation in our own evolution as teachers?
 
If you feel inclined, participate and share your learning and experiences with others on the private social forum where you will have special access. This helps others on the path and builds a strong community.
 
Whether you just read your first spiritual book, recently experienced a shift in consciousness, or suddenly became curious, *The School of Awakening* will help you explore the depths of your personal awakening in a nondogmatic and experiential way.
 
Do you want to experience more freedom in your work life? Discover your unique purpose? Create more meaningful relationships with your family or loved ones? *The School of Awakening* will help you answer these questions with clarity and focus.
 
If you are on this path, then you know that awakening is not a destination but a journey of discovery. The problem is that even experienced seekers face new challenges and suffer from new attachments.
 
Personal awakening naturally leads to a desire to share and contribute to the evolution of consciousness. If you want to be of service to the world and have a meaningful impact, *The School of Awakening* can help you discover your unique purpose.
