Most weapons can be collected in a single playthrough, but weapons crafted from boss souls can only be crafted once per playthrough. Most boss souls offer the option to create two different weapons, but the Soul of Sif can be used to create three different weapons, thus New Game+2 (a third playthrough) would be required to craft all possible variants. Weapons from the DLC *Artorias of the Abyss* are not required for this achievement/trophy.

These weapons are obtained by cutting the tail of certain enemies. You may only get one chance at most of these weapons until the next playthrough, as the enemies do not appear again, with the exception of the Gargoyles and the Stone Dragon.
 
These weapons can only be obtained by defeating certain enemies throughout the game. Most weapons have a low drop rate, which means it may take several attempts for the enemy to drop the desired weapon.
 
Black Knight weapons are only dropped by Black Knights who wield that weapon. Most knights in the game do not respawn, however the five Black Knights guarding the Kiln of the First Flame do. All four variants can be found here, making it a perfect location to obtain these weapons.

Silver Knight weapons are significantly rarer than Black Knight weapons, with drop rates at between 1 and 2 percent. Silver Knights can only be found in Anor Londo. Like the Black Knights, they only drop the weapons they wield in battle. Sword and spear wielding knights can be found in the various rooms within the main building.

Among those being honored and receiving recognition for their achievements were, from left, Baci Carpico, past state deputy; Erol Hosdil, district deputy; Brendan Grimm, youth of the year; the Rev. James Dunfee, chaplain of the year; Grand Knight Shawn Zarych; Scott Fabian, knight of the year; and Tony Offenberger, state warden.
 
I am wondering about the "Ghost Blade" - not the "Jagged Ghost Blade" which I have a dozen of - resources online seem to be unsure if it is required for the achievement, and I've killed a lot of ghosts without seeing one - does anybody know anything about this weapon, or who drops it?
 
I wonder if it is the screaming ghosts (their knives look less jagged) but there are only like 3 of them in all of New Londo, so having to farm them would be a son-of-a for real. Also, I'm on NG+ and ghosts do sick damage to me.
 
You should not need either of the ghost blades as I finished this achievement to platinum the game and the only weapon extra that i had in my inventory that is not listed is the regular ghost blade which i had got thx to just clearing the place to the 4kings. You should not need it as this wiki page has been updated alot since the games launch and many of the other weapons have been taken off that are not needed. Also on your NG+ finishing with those trophies left, The miracles will not be easy as you just got to NG++ and if you did not get the Darkwraiths stuff eariler, your gonna be in for a tough fight : /. 4kings on NG+ was hard enough solo but they are the last thing i need to kill before i can go on and kill gwyn for ng++ finish :(
 
The only miracles I don't have are the Sunlight Warriors ones and the Darkmoon Blade Covenant one. So I figure I'll either not S rank it, or just run though crit-pathing to get the miracles as quickly as possible.
 
I missed certain miracles on my first playthrough due to me not deciding to platinum early on which resulted in alot more work to finish that then was originally needed. The weapons honestly was the hardest one as some of the mobs refused to drop their weapons without a few hours of farming them. Like the channelers trident. Friend got it first time clearing the archives without even trying to get it while it took me almost 4hours of farming with 70 humanity and the loot ring.. The harpies also were not fun farming as i had the same amount of item discovery (390ish) and they would drop maybe 1 every 4-5times clearing all of them.. that took many hours and a few MST3K episodes :(
 
My tip for those about to farm it: Save at the bonfire at the end of the archives (the one you'll be spawning from when you are entering the crystal caverns/fighting Seath). Wear your gold serpent ring, and RUN PAST THE CRYSTAL SOLDIERS! They have a huge (by comparison) chance to drop crystal swords and shields -- and it seems to me that if you kill them as you make your way the Channelers in the library, they'll drop that garbage and use up the game's drop allowances for that section.
 
I read this online and I was ready to try anything at that point, having farmed away for like 2 hours already. First try I get a drop the the Channeler - but then I get shot by the other channeler before I could pick it up. Like 10 tries later I got another drop from them, and had my prize.
 
I've started working on this achievement on NG+. I wasted all the boss souls on my first playthrough for souls. Only weapons I need are the Cursed Sword Of Artorias and the other Moonlight Butterfly weapon (I've got the shield). Got Moonlight Greatsword today, it was a bitch to get. Took me like 30 minutes of running around Seath just to get to his tail, but I got it on my first try and managed to kill him too, felt so good :P
 
Also, I got the trident on my first playthrough without even trying. I just need all Miracles/Sorceries/Pyro spells and Chaos/Crystal/Magic weapons maxed (does the Chaos Blade from Quelaag count as a Chaos weapon?) to get 1000/1000. Still a long way to go, but I don't mind. This game rules!
 
No, there is an actual chaos upgrade for weapons which requires a +5 fire weapon i think to get.. Might be 10, i dont remember correctly as that was the first weapons i fully upgraded and still use from time to time is my chaos Bastard sword.. Gl on getting all the spells / pyro / miracles on the same character through NG+ / ng++.. some of those are best to just get on another character for the first playthrough as the ways to get them get alot harder in later playthroughs. But quelaags furysword does go towards the knights honour trophy.
 
I managed to get all the spells and pyromancies in NG+. But I'm pretty sure I'll have to start over if I want to get All Miracles. I wasted most of my sunbro medals at the end of my first playthough, and I broke Soliare's chain by going to fight the chaos bugs TOO EARLY (I cursed a fair bit when he didn't appear for the centipede and I knew I had screwed it up). And the Tokens of Reprisal are not realistically farmable. Oh well. I'm in NG++ now, I've got my third Sif's soul and just have to get to Anor Londo now. I think I have all of the other weapons I need. Also I need one more white titanite slab because I missed it in my first playthough.
 
So I check the list more carefully, and the only thing I'm missing is the Black Knight Great Axe. There is one dude who has one chance to drop it in the Catacombs, and if he doesn't drop it, I'll have to get to the Kiln of the First Flame again.
 
**@LeenPonyD**: Yeah, I know. But that does mean getting though the game again. At least this time should be the fastest yet, I don't even have to stop for most of the embers or other distractions. Crap, just realized I need the dark ember for the 'occult weapon' achievement, so I'll have to run though the Painted World anyways, nuts.
 
its not so bad. I ran through NG++ in about 3 hours dieing only a few times. mainly the 4 kings :D.. Was the fastest i ran through the game yet and i skipped 90% of the mobs.. i did however fight every boss so that is probably why it took me that long..Also the black knight who drops the axe has a really low chance and is the 4th out of the 5 knights to gwyn.. took me a few hours to get his axe to drop but it is my main weapon now at +5..
