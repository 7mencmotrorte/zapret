Avakin Life is a very similar game to The Sims, apart from the fact that it is multiplayer - with a huge world full of players playing along with you. It has an in-depth character creation system and allows you to go from creating your character to building your dream home. Unlike The Sims, you cannot actually control more than one character, but you can explore a world that has many characters!

Idle Life Sim has a lot of similar features to The Sims - you start off by customizing your avatar and then gaining a little house. You can work your way up to a much bigger home, and decorate the entire place, purchasing new items for it. In your career, you can start your job and progress, getting pay raises and earning prestige. There are also decisions to be made on how you spend your time and what you are doing with your character, which does affect them.
 
A few weeks ago I was invited to Hollywood, LA by EA for EA Play, there I was able to try out the new Sims Mobile game, give my feedback to the developers and capture some content to share with you all over the next few months, I had a great time meeting other gamers and getting my first chance to play the game so thank you for flying me out for the event EA!
 
There are loads of different aspects to the game that I am going to briefly explain and give my opinions on them, I will go into more detail on these topics at a later date when the game has been released worldwide.
 
This is a fast paced real time game where most actions take 5 seconds to complete which means there is a lot of tapping! In one way I really like this as you can play for a long period of time before you run out of energy (energy, hunger, hygiene and fun are the 4 needs you have in this game, once you run out of a need you will need to refill using an object which takes a few hours so you can take a break) If you decide to speed up the refilling using simcash instead of waiting then the repetitive tapping can become a little boring.
 
The main point of this game is legacies and generations so your sims complete life goals and the more life goals they complete the better heirloom they will leave behind for the next generation, heirlooms unlock new items and interactions in the game. This does mean that your sims will age automatically every day and at the moment they live for about 12 days in total

There are loads of events in the game for careers, hobbies, building relationships, earning party points and special events which are all longer events but have 5 second tasks within them, you need to complete the 5 second tasks to fill up the stars, once the stars are full you complete the event and earn event related rewards. The higher the level you are in a career, hobby or friendship the more stars you will need to fill to complete these events. I love the fast pace to these events and that you can go to work as many times as you want or can during a day!
 
Overall I really enjoyed playing The Sims Mobile at EA Play and I cannot wait for the game to be available worldwide! Just to recap I really love the speed of the game and the create a sim options but there are some issues including buy mode as mentioned above but also we really need a camera on the screen and when completing events if you select a 5 second option it zooms right in and then you have to zoom out again when the task is complete to pick the next one which is quite annoying.
 
You will see little squares appear on a surface that you can place that item on, if there are no squares you cannot place it there, usually big items like coffee machines need a whole counter, there is a picture explaining this on this page: -mobile/faqs-about-the-sims-mobile/
 
Mods have suggested a number of things, tried a few things on their end, and asked me to buy another SIM card. Did that, used self-serve to change the SIM, still "No Service". Mod did some kind of 'activation' thing on their end, still no change.
 
My referrer found this thread that got resolved by having the mods open a support ticket, but is there anything else I should be trying while I await that? (Request was just sent, so another 2 day wait most likely)
 
It's sad that the system offers you numbers that are in use. The last number I selected also belonged to someone whereas this new one is simply not in service. Hopefully they work on fixing it... What a frustrating situation. Bell cost a lot more but I never experienced anything like this before
 
The number available to you but no longer available / already assigned would be due chron update if I am correct. Perhaps adjusting the system to actually update on get and also update on confirmation selection as well as recheck during confirmation/final account creation/submition on the users end to both check primary db as well as update whatever root number archive
 
Yeah the number was changed as soon as I realized that it was now someone else's but still displayed as mine on the public mobile portal. Sadly the new number is inactive still. I don't know how long it will take for it to be mine although it's shown as it is.
 
I don't understand why that would be the case. I had auto pay on and the money was being taken from my account. Let's say that was the case, once I changed the number, why would the system not generate a proper new working number for me? I even added an extra $15 in there to make sure it wasn't a payment issue but I don't think so
 
Wow this is very similar to the issues I've been facing. I purchased the plan for my little sister months ago thinking it might go away but a few days ago was her birthday and I gave her the phone with the sim card to find out it doesn't work. I'm very disappointed. I planned in advance and I still ended up in this situation. I tried changing the number, but it is still saying not in service. It's been a few days since I changed it. The moderator gave me steps to take, same situation. Members of the community gave me steps to take and same issue. I can't confirm that the service hasn't worked for over 3 months because the sim card was just sitting here not being used. I was paying for it so I can't imagine they just sold the number to someone else.... The first number when I tried calling from my own phone was to someone else who set a voicemail. I also put the sim in my phone which is an Android and it did not work either. The phone I bought her was the iPhone SE. I looked it up, nothing wrong with it, not blacklisted or anything. I have the receipt for it. I just want someone to solve this so I can give her the gift properly with no issues.
 
About all I can suggest is to keep going with the moderators until it gets solved - either one will confirm that the account was closed due to inactivity (although if you can still change your number then it implies an active account) or there's some other problem afoot.
 
Turns out the provisioning problem was that the number I selected to use when first signing up was already in use somehow and that's why my SIM wouldn't work. I gave some suggestion for an alternate number and was given it, with a new tech support ticket generated (response within 72 hours).
 
No access to an Android phone, at least one that takes the same SIM card size, but wouldn't testing on two other unlocked iPhones be the same as testing on an Android phone in terms of troubleshooting?
 
@bartoDo note response from moderators can be slow.. so like anything important.. do prepare a backup plan if things go awry. Simple things like no use your Public Mobile phone as a 2FA verification etc will minimize your stress level.
 
I did find the new one - it was still in a spare iPhone 6. I tried resetting the network settings on that first, restarted, but same thing. This one I wasn't positive was ever unlocked (unlike the other two iPhones I had been trying in addition)
 
If it's locked you should see "SIM Not Valid" or more likely "SIM Not Supported", and then info about the phone not being supported under the activation policy. But you're just seeing "No Service"? How about the Carrier profile (Settings --> General --> About --> Carrier)?
 
so I tried it in my iPhone 8 Plus. When I swapped SIMs to the new one, I initially got asked to enter a phone number for MMS messages, but I ignored that (partly since I couldn't remember it and couldn't find it in My Account) and just did the reset of network settings, with the automatic restart of the phone.
