The sections of this manual **are available in English, Spanish, Chinese or Russian.** The table below matches the sections to the knowledge and skills tests that you must pass to receive a Commercial Driver License (CDL) in the correct Class with the required endorsements. To get the section you want to study, click on the name of the section, in either English, Spanish, Chinese or Russian, in the column on the left. (Many of these files are very large and can take a long time to download.) To test your knowledge of information covered in the Commercial Driver's Manual, see the list of study questions.
 
The Driver's Manual course is an eight-hour course based on the Virginia driver's manual and designed for individuals who have failed the knowledge test three times. This course may be taken either in a classroom or online through a DMV-licensed driving school.
 
When symbolising quantities, and classifying using the manual method, you can't change the number of classes. The classes box is greyed out, so you can't click on it, and so is the right click option to insert a break. If you need another class the only way i have found is to change the method (wiping all the breaks you have manually set), change the classes and then change it back to manual. Can we please have an option to add classes for this method?

Per this thread, it is not currently possible to modify the number of classes when using manual interval classification in graduated color symbology. The number of classes is there, but it is grayed out. There is a workaround, but it is tedious and destroys any values and symbology already set - flip to another method, add a class, flip back to manual, and reset your class breaks and symbology manually. That's not ideal, so I'm looking for the class number selector to be enabled here.
 
As one comment mentioned in the previous thread, this is by design. Because with customized classes, it will be hard for us to decide where to add a new one or to remove which class. Any action might ruin existing manual classifications, so we grey out the classes control.
 
W have this more flexible function to update classes: if you right click on a row, you can choose to add a break above or below, and this will update the number of classes and don't need to switch to another method. Hope it will help.
 
In the **Class Details** section, you can change the classes name, description, and card color. The color dropdown in the upper right of the Class Details section allows you to select the color that will be used in the rest of the Securly Classroom interface to refer to that class.
 
**Add new student** allows you to add a student by typing in their email address. Make sure you use their school email address that is associated with their Google Workspace account. You will also need to enter their first and last name.
 
To delete a manual class, go to the **Classes** menu, then switch to list view by clicking the list view icon on the right side of the filter bar. On any manual class you wish to delete, click the overflow menu (3 dots), then select **Delete this class**.
 
Neurodynamics is the physical ability of the nervous system allowing it to move, slide, glide and accommodate human movement and function. Compared to more traditional manual therapy models focusing on joints and muscles, neurodynamics is new and vitally important in restoring normal movement and function. To understand the physical movement of nerves, neuroscience knowledge is explored to understand how pain works from a neurobiological and neurophysiological perspective.

I have been looking for THE manual for using class 'article' in LaTex.The official CTAN package site points to some documentation which actually is 'an introduction to writing classes and packages for LATEX'; it does not cover how to use the article package.
 
I need to, for instance, check what is the command for inserting affiliations, or to place in-text references, among other typical tasks you will do while preparing a scientific paper. I would like to have the official way to do that at hand. Looking in Google for those commands returns disparate solutions relying on additional packages. And that is something I must avoid because of editorial regulations.
 
It looks like the journal you're contemplating submitting your paper to requires you to use the article class but doesn't provide any real guidelines regarding the layout of the title and author blocks. I would therefore go with a minimalist layout. For instance,
 
In scripting, the GameObject class provides a collection of methods which allow you to work with them in your code, including finding, making connections and sending messages between GameObjects, and adding or removing components attached to the GameObject, and setting values relating to their status within the scene.
 
GameObjects are active by default, but can be deactivated, which turns off all components attached to the GameObject. This generally means it will become invisible, and not receive any of the normal callbacks or events such as Update or FixedUpdate.
 
**Tags** provide a way of marking and identifying types of GameObject in your scene and **Layers** provide a similar but distinct way of including or excluding groups of GameObjects from certain built-in actions, such as rendering or physics collisions.
 
You can add or remove components at runtime, which can be useful for procedurally creating GameObjects, or modifying how a GameObject behaves. Note, you can also enable or disable script components, and some types of built-in component, via script without destroying them.
 
The best way to add a component at runtime is to use AddComponent, specifying the type of component within angle brackets as shown. To remove a component, you must use Object.Destroy method on the component itself.
 
The simplest case is where a script on a GameObject needs to access another Component attached to the same GameObject (remember, other scripts attached to a GameObject are also Components themselves). To do this, the first step is to get a reference to the Component instance you want to work with. This is done with the GetComponent method. Typically, you want to assign the Component object to a variable, which is done in using the following code. In this example the script is getting a reference to a **Rigidbody**A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info  
See in Glossary component on the same GameObject:
 
Note: you can have multiple custom scripts attached to the same GameObject. If you need to access one script from another, you can use GetComponent as usual and just use the name of the script class (or the filename) to specify the Component type you want.
 
Additionally, if you declare a public variable of a Component type in your script, you can drag any GameObject that has that Component attached onto it. This accesses the Component directly rather than the GameObject itself.
 
This can be useful when a GameObject has a child GameObject that can be added and removed during gameplay. A tool or utensil that can be picked up and put down during gameplay is a good example of this.
 
BroadcastMessage allows you to send out a call to a named method, without being specific about where that method should be implemented. You can use it to call a named method on every MonoBehaviour on a particular GameObject or any of its children. You can optionally choose to enforce that there must be at least one receiver (or an error is generated).
 
Note that the Destroy function can destroy individual components and not affect the GameObject itself. A common mistake is to write this and assume it destroys the GameObject the script is attached to:
