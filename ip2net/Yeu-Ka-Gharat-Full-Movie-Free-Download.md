The book contains selected parts of Imam Ali's (a) life, some of his sermons, letters, advice and also the reports about the battles and conflicts during and after his caliphate. Because the book contains the reports about the raids launched by Mu'awiya's army on Imam Ali's (a) territory, it was called "al-Gharat" (the Raids). The author has narrated form both Shi'a and Sunni hadith transmitters, which made the book a rich history source. Shi'a scholars have always paid attention and referred to *al-Gharat*. Al-'Allama al-Majlisi and Ibn Abi l-Hadid played an important role in the survival of this book. *Al-Gharat* is translated into Persian several times.
 
Abu Ishaq Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Sa'id b. Hilal al-Thaqafi al-Isfahani, known as Ibn Hilal al-Thaqafi is a Shi'a muhaddith, faqih and historian of the 3rd/9th century. He traveled to Isfahan to propagate Islam and resided there. Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Khalid al-Barqi and Saffar al-Qummi are among the most eminent narrators who have narrated hadiths from Ibn Hilal. Most Shi'a scholars praised him and counted him among the reliable narrators. His most famous book is *al-Gharat*, which is about the raids conducted by Mu'awiya's army on the territory of Imam Ali's Caliphate.

In some sources, the name *al-Istinfar wa l-gharat* and in some *al-Asfar wa l-gharat* are mentioned as the title of the book.[1] However, among scholars and also in scholarly circles it is widely known as *al-Gharat*. It seems that the title of the book is taken from a phrase in one of Imam Ali's (a) sermons.
 
The purpose of the author from writing the book was reporting the raids conducted by Mu'awiya's army, after the Battle of Nahrawan, on the territory controlled by Imam Ali's Caliphate; therefore, the book was called *al-Gharat* (the raids). Writing about this topic was common at that time, as other historians, such as: Kalbi, Abu Mikhnaf, Mada'ini and Nasr b. Muzahim - all of whom are among the masters (Mashayikh) of Ibn Hilal - have written books about this subject and under the same title.[2]
 
Although the subject of the book is the raids conducted by Mu'awia's army on the territory of Imam Ali's Caliphate, other useful topics that are not related directly to the main subject are mentioned in the book, such as: a brief history of Imam Ali's life, his administrative procedure, economic policies, political and moral behaviors, his sermons, some of his representatives such as Qays b. Sa'd, Muhammad b. Abi Bakr, Malik al-Ashtar and what happened to them.[3]
 
The chapters, their titles and the structure of the book is very well-arranged and its content is very rich. Ibn Hilal hardly narrated form Shi'a Imams and narrators in his book, rather he narrated from famous Sunni narrators such as the narrators of Hadiths in al-Sihah al-Sitta and famous Sunni Musnads.[5]
 
'Abbas b. al-Sari, Muhammad b. Zayd al-Rattab and Ahmad b. 'Alawiyya al-Isfahani, known as Ibn Aswad al-Katib, have reported the index of the books written by Ibn Hilal. Al-Shaykh al-Saduq narrated Ibn Hilal's books from his father, who has narrated them from 'Abd Allah b. Hasan Mu'addib, who has narrated them from Ahmad b. 'Alawiyya al-Isfahani. However, it is not known that how some books such as al-Gharat were narrated; although some scholars such as Ibn Abi l-Hadid and Hasan b. Sulayman al-Hilli, the student of al-Shahid al-Awwal, have quoted from it directly.[6] According to Muhaddith al-Urmavi the copies of the book were very scarce from the early centuries.[7]
 
Despite the reputation and importance of the book, not many manuscripts of it are available. As the editor of the book, Muhaddith al-Urmavi, said the copies of the book were very scarce since early times. The earliest known manuscript of the book was in possession of al-'Allama al-Majlisi. This manuscript was transcribed during Safavid era.

THE traditional gharat (water wheel) has caught the technologist's eye and deceptively simple modifications to its design have made it at least 40 per cent more efficient and also enlarged its capability so that it can power several machines simultaneously. 

The gharat, in use for centuries in the Himalayan region, can be developed into an excellent alternate energy source for far-flung, hill villages. Even today, Chamba district commissioner S Pidke explained, "except in the plains areas, gharats are found in almost all areas of Himachal Pradesh." 

Taking off from this traditional method of exploiting running water as a renewable energy source, agencies such as Himurja in Himachal Pradesh, Agro Engineering Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh and Institute Technologique in Dello, Nepal, have used the gharat principle to develop innovative single and multimachine designs. 

Shimla-based Himurja's new designs are 40 to 50 per cent more energy efficient than traditional gharats. Positioned under a 10 m waterfall, the Himurja design has a capacity of 10 hp or 7,500 watts. While the traditional system was used only for powering mills, the modified multimachine version can be used to run oil expellers and for flour mills and rice husking, wood cutting, cotton landing and wool weaving machines, either singly or severally and also simultaneously. Small quantities of electricity, sufficient for a few rural households, can also be generated through improved water mills. 

Surjan Singh, an enterprising machine-shop owner, has installed several multimachine gharats in Chamba and neighbouring districts and has ventured even as far as Bosoli, in Jammu & Kashmir. In Holi, some 80 km from Chamba a typical Surjan Singh multimachine gharat successfully operates a wheat mill, a saw mill and a loom (wool-weaving machine) simultaneously. And in Andral, another village in Chamba, a cluster of commercially run gharats is proving to be a profitable venture. In the Bondilla, Kalaktung and Thimbu areas of Arunachal Pradesh, too, similar multimachine gharats are working efficiently. 

Traditional watermills, made by village carpenters and blacksmiths from locally available materials, consist of a wooden turbine and wooden or iron blades that rotate when water flows over it. A shaft connects the wheel to a rotating stone, which moves against a stationary grinding stone. Water from a stream is diverted through an open wooden channel to fall from a height of about 8 metres on to the turbine, thereby activating the system. In order to stop the machine, the gharati (operator) just changes the direction in which the water flows on to the blades. 

In the improved gharat, the traditional wooden turbine has been replaced by a cast iron one and has fewer runner blades -- no more than 18 as compared to 28 in traditional gharats. The blades have holes at the periphery to ensure an even flow of water and smooth movement of the turbine. The traditional gharat's stone bearings have been replaced by cast iron and mild steel bearings, thereby increasing the number of revolutions per minute. 

Traditional watermills are still being used in the hill areas, but in some places they are giving way to electric atta chakkis (flour mills). In the plains areas of Chamba district, where gharats were once common, their decline is appreciable. All the villages in the district are electrified and electric atta chakkis are gaining in popularity. 

Originally, gharats were owned and operated by gharatis, for whom this was a family tradition. They were paid in kind, usually a kilogram of grain for every 15 kg of grain ground. In Chamba, however, gharatis are now opting for other professions because of meagre earnings and because of fierce competition from more conveniently located, electric atta chakkis. 

The modified versions are more efficient, but they face an uphill task in gaining acceptance, especially in the more remote regions, because some of the parts have to be brought in from faraway towns. The multimachine gharat could perhaps compete commercially with electrically run machines, but the government is doing little to popularise this technology and the task has been left to local entrepreneurs. 

They are being marketed by Himurja through the Khadi and Village Commission, with project officers stationed in each district, but poor advertising of the improved models, which cost about Rs 12,000 each, is responsible for poor sales of improved gharats. For example, Balaram Mahajan, a gharati from Dulara, bought an inferior turbine from a local shop and paid a high price because he was not aware that the subsidised price was Rs 500. 

This versatile technology has considerable potential in other hilly areas as well, according to Gopinath Padhi, chief engineer of the Suvarnarekha Irrigation Project. "The watermill," he said, "could function in some areas of the Similipal hill range in Orissa." This is equally true also of other hilly regions with water sources, even streams, as can be found in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and in the north-eastern states.
