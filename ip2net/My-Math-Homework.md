I've found practice with LaTeX makes you faster. Now, I've got a writing disability, so writing out a good copy that other people can read takes me a long time, but I find with practice LaTeX isn't that slow. Also, the first assignment in it, getting the preamble set up and whatnot is the slowest part. After that it should be faster; I did a lot of my university homework in LaTeX.

Some advice: Don't worry about making your code pretty. I put one sentence, equation, etc per line to make debugging easier. Sometimes I'll even break up formulas and such to show bracket matching, like you would in a C program or such.
 
Write out a 'good enough' copy. This is a copy that removes all the stuff that is scribbled out, where you went down dead paths, etc. But isn't in nice writing or whatnot. Legible, enough, but not pretty as a formal good copy. That way if a deadline is looming, you can say, good enough and just hand that in.
 
Don't be afraid to be almost right. Don't want to take the time to figure out how to do a specific symbol? Use an easier one, and then define it in text. You see old textbooks do that all the time if they couldn't type R in the fancy real number font. Or if you need to make a figure and it would take a while in LaTeX? Open up Paint or The Gimp or whatever and then insert it as an image.
 
Compile early, and often, and do so from the command line. That way you'll see where you made a mistake right away, and not have to go hunting for where you made that error. I often keep writing in my text editor while it compiles in the command line window.
 
The learning curve vor LaTeX sure is steep, but if you have recurring tasks it will be much easier. So for the specific question of your homework I guess you will become much faster after you've done the layout two or three times.
 
The thing I personally noticed with LaTeX is that it encourages my perfectionist side. Because I know that almost everything I want can be done in LaTeX, a lot of time goes into fiddling around with the small details to create an aesthetically pleasing result.
 
Looking further into the future, I wholeheartedly recommend practicing LaTeX as early as possible. I made the effort to write all my lab reports during my study in LaTeX and it was a very good practice for my thesis. But this might depend on your field and your own plan for bigger projects like a thesis in the future.

I might add an anectode: When my girlfriend wrote her thesis (in a very non-technical field and using MS Word) she asked me to help her with creating an appendix consisting of nothing but a dozen images plus some captions. I thought it would be easy to just drop the images into the existing document, add some captions and shuffle them in a good order. After trying for over an hour and ending up with jumbled captions and a lot of crashes I finally started up LaTeX and finished the task without headache in less than 30 minutes. And I think this was made possible by practicing with the small lab reports every week for the past year.
 
So I strongly suspect that one of my students is asking all their homework questions here. In particular, all the questions that user8917 has asked about probability are homework questions that I have assigned in my current course. I am using a standard text (Pitman, *Probability*), so coincidence is possible, but there are many problems in our textbook that I have not assigned -- it seems unlikely that a person studying the book on their own, or even a person in another class using the same book, would choose exactly the same set of problems to be handed in.
 
My policy on academic dishonesty is simply that students cannot copy their answers from *any* source, although of course with relatively simple problems this is difficult to impossible to enforce. I of course would not want to forbid my students to use sites such as this one - if they have more general questions, or questions which are not specifically "how do I do this homework problem". But I don't want people solving my students' homework questions for them! I would appreciate the community's advice on what I can do here.
 
This is in some respect a repeat of this question, regarding a similar anonymous user who consistently asked homework questions; the major difference is that I, the instructor, am the one who noticed this.
 
I say let your students gather their learning how they wish. If you want to grade them based on their abilities use in class tests. And by the way, do not let them bring their cell phones or "calculators" into the test room.
 
I never assign book problems in my classes. Composing my own problems is a **lot** more work, of course, but I feel it's necessary. It's too easy these days to find answers to text problems (especially popular texts!) on the web.
 
My favorite types of problems, in fact, are those where I find **wrong** answers on the web. I truly relish these. Over time I have found wrong proofs published in solution packs from professors in top-notch places, UC San Diego, Sanford, MIT, etc. Perhaps they're doing it on purpose, and if so... I am grateful to them.
 
In my quest to use original problems, Math.SE (and similar sites) creates a problem: not only does asking here spur 20-30 PhDs to vigorously compete for rep, racing to answer my students' homeworks, but it also permanently renders the problems useless. So I'm forced to find new problems every term.
 
I was hesitant to suggest my approach as "an answer" to your question, since adopting it requires a ton of extra work. But it's what I do, despite the fact that online forums teeming with experts is making this approach less effective with each passing semester.
 
The era of the internet is upon us can be thought of in another way. You may very well have students not asking questions on here because they already have a copy of the full instructors' solutions manual, because these days you can download these as PDFs on various file sharing sites. At least, I know many of my Calc 1 students had this a year ago. I caught 9/40 cheating on one homework assignment, mainly because of one question where they all had a very similar answer and used something we had not talked much about. I gave them all 0s, told the class I knew about and told them not to do it. And, still I had 2 of these same people do it again and 1 other student do it who was not caught on this assignment. This situation is worse than asking on here because it takes no effort at all. You don't have to ask any questions. You can do your entire assignment in 10 or 15 minutes of copying out of the manual. One problem though is these students don't learn anything so most will do terrible on tests.
 
Since then, I assign homework but never collect it. I give weekly quizzes. This encourages them to do the homework weekly and not wait until right before the test to do a month's worth of homework. I also usually don't make them all that hard so it still has the benefit of giving easy points to the students, as homework does. I even do 12 of them and drop the 2 lowest.
 
I thought that my Calculus professor was rather clever in this regard. He simply wrote a set of question numbers from the textbook at the end of each lecture, and each set were worth the same number of points. He told us upfront that the way the point-system was set up, we could get an A in the class without doing any homework, because the homework was only a couple points tacked on to an examination grade. He hinted that if we understood how to solve the homework problems, we would not be surprised by the examinations.
 
For me, this tactic changed the economics of the homework. We weren't rewarded enough for turning in a completed homework assignment for cheating to be worthwhile. **The real reward in completing the homework was in the knowledge that it would prepare you for the upcoming examination**. The homework was more like a pre-test for our benefit, as opposed to sadistic busywork. It simply didn't make sense to cheat on the homework.
 
As a result, the professor didn't have to concern himself with cheaters because they would end up failing the exams. If they were able to cheat and still pass, they really didn't need to do the homework. And students who wanted to cut corners could just not turn in the homework at all and face no penalty. Everyone saved a lot of time while reaching the same end. All that is required for this to work is that the tests be sufficiently difficult, which I would think is much easier when you can focus on them instead of making a whole lot of unique homework problems to prevent cheating there.
