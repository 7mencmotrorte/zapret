But when I think of Halloween, my thoughts also turn to our late great president, Richard Milhous Nixon. For three straight years, from when I was eight until I was eleven, my trick-or-treating itinerary had Nixon's rambling ranch home as its high point. For all the children of Saddle River, New Jersey, the Nixon residence was a Halloween must-see.
 
**T**he house was surrounded by trees, dense shrubbery and a high wall. The driveway was normally blocked by a heavy gate. But on Halloween, the gate was swung wide open, offering trick-or-treaters (and their curious parents) an invitation to enter.
 
Next to the gate was a small wooden guardhouse. I was told that this was where Nixon's Secret Service agents were stationed. When I went trick-or-treating at the Nixons, I never saw anyone inside the guardhouse. No Secret Service agents frisked me for weapons concealed in my costume.

Each Halloween, Richard and Pat Nixon would stand on their broad doorstep, greeting their guests with smiles and handshakes. They were flanked on both sides by enormous wicker baskets overflowing with candy and other treats.
 
If you weren't too nervous, you might be able to say something like, "Hello, Mr. President." If you were as nervous as I was on my first trip, you would mumble something incoherent. Nixon would smile at both responses. Perhaps he was kind; perhaps he was deaf.
 
After shaking his hand, you would proceed to the next station: the baskets and their diverse treats. While the candies were small, you could take as many as you wanted. No Secret Service agents monitored the flow of candy into your bag.
 
Several hyperactive small children, without costumes, would swarm around the Nixons. They ran around the driveway and consumed large amounts of sugar. They appeared to be the Nixon grandchildren, and they had important roles to play in the Halloween drama. When a candy basket was empty, they would run inside the house and scream, "More candy! More candy!"
 
Looking back, I feel pity for poor Mr. Nixon. There he was, standing on his doorstep for hours on end, shaking hand after hand in the October chill. Worst of all, he had to endure those shouting, hyperactive kids. I bet they made Nixon nostalgic for Kissinger.
 
The Nixon treats did not stop at candy. The Nixons always had what could be described as a supplementary treat to accompany the standard Halloween fare. These treats invariably capitalized on the Nixon fame (or infamy, as the case might be).
 
One year the Nixons gave away small orange cards with drawings of witches and black cats on them. At the top of the card was printed, "The Nixon Family wishes you a Happy Halloween." Below the message was what made the card so valuable: the signature of Richard Milhous Nixon. These cards made excellent refrigerator decorations.
 
Another year, Nixon gave away elegant brass pens in gift boxes. Each pen had Nixon's signature engraved on the barrel. They were beautiful pens. But Tricky Dick was not above a small act of deception.
 
As soon as my hand touched the cool metal, I drew back. I realized, with fear and horror, what I had done. Without anyone's permission, I had left the blemish of my finger-print on the car of a great and powerful man. I stood next to the car for half a minute frozen, waiting for the Secret Service agents to apprehend me.
 
**S**everal years after I retired my plastic pumpkin candy carrier, Nixon moved away. He left Saddle River and took up residence in a townhouse in nearby Park Ridge. The townhouse was much easier to maintain than the sprawling Nixon estate. Since his departure, Saddle River and its trick-or-treating scene have never been the same.
 
This Halloween, take some time to reflect on Nixon and the many years he spent serving our nation. Like all of us, the great man had his faults and his difficulties. He gave out pens that did not work. And there was that business about Watergate.
 
My very first show was motivated not by the desire to find a way to make up for lost income, but rather to save the birthday of a child that was very important to me after having stayed in touch with her family after my first time performing for her birthday a couple years ago. And so I went all in, spending every bit of my time, creativity, thought, and funding to make it the best show possible.
 
How did it go? Well, while many might expect my first virtual show would have been a bit rocky, it was instead a huge success! And I knew right then and there that this was something I was great at, and I had to get the word out so I could save even more birthdays and special occasions.
 
Some days it means waking up at 4am to start a 6am show for a 2pm party in Ireland, or maybe staying up late to do an 11:30pm show for a 4:30pm party in Australia, or spending every waking moment in front of a computer screen, performing shows, and responding to emails in between shows. And yet every bit of that makes me feel like the luckiest magician on the planet right now, being able to spread laughter, smiles, and amazing memories all around the world during a time when smiles have been in short supply for many.
 
I've been pulling my hair out over some what I think might be impossible, or tricky KQL (but then again - I could be missing something). I have a report that does a comparison of the last 30 days, and last 60 days of alerts received via. Sentinel. The query I've been using to get two tables individually was the below;
 
When put into "chart view", this does emit the correct values and works fine - but combining the two into a comparison as such, from what I can tell, seems impossible. I've also tried to leverage PowerBI to do this too but again, have spent hours looking into it and can't figure out how to do it.
 
The patient, a male in his mid-30s presented to the practice requesting improved aesthetics of the lower anterior teeth. Dark/black triangles had developed after fixed orthodontic treatment implemented to correct moderate to severe anterior crowding of the lower anterior teeth.
Initially a referral was made to a periodontist for possible gingival and bone grafting procedures, but it was deemed unpredictable in this case. Other restorative options offered to the patient included indirect restorations; veneers and crowns. These were not a conservative option due to the aggressive nature of the required preparations to achieve the desired aesthetic result. Patient opted for a minimally invasive approach.
 
The challenge was that traditional composite bonding techniques including the use of cellular strip and sculptable composite resin can be cumbersome to manage interproximal embrasure areas and contacts. The Patient was happy with ortho treatment result but very conscious of the resultant dark triangles.
 
Pre-treatment smile frontal. Presentation of black triangles in the lower anterior region. Patient also had a fixed lingual re tainer that needed to be removed before the restorative procedure commenced.
 
Rubber dam isolation. No LA required as this procedure is atraumatic and does not require any removal of tooth structure. Meticulous removal of biofilm before commencing bonding procedure is essential to allow optimal bond strength to uncut enamel and infinity edge margins.
 
i have found this arpeggio/string skipping exercise on songsterr which is credited to steve morse, altough i havent found any information about it on the internet
the string skipping makes it pretty tricky and im not quite sure how to tackle it, maybe practicing string tracking could help
 
If you desire a method that requires a little less coordination, you may consider trying an oral irrigator (also called a water flosser). The apparatus emits a pressurized mist of water that helps to free trapped particles and plaque.
 
Another option is to use an interproximal brush, which is designed to probe the narrow spaces to agitate and remove debris. Just be sure not to choose the kind made with metal wire, as it could scratch your implants.
 
In addition to preventing the development of gum disease, diligently cleaning in the hard-to-reach spaces will help to extend the life of your implants and restoration. Therefore, you can look forward to enjoying decades of smile bliss!
